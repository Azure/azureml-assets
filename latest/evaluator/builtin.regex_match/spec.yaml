description: "Evaluates whether a model response matches one or more regex patterns.
  Patterns can include {{ground_truth}} which is resolved per-row from the ground_truth
  parameter. Returns a binary accuracy score: 1.0 if any pattern matches, 0.0 otherwise.
  Designed for benchmarking tasks where correctness is determined by pattern matching."
