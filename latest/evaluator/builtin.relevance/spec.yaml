description: "| \t| |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range |\tInteger [1-5]: 1 is the lowest
  quality and 5 is the highest quality. |\n| What is this metric? | Coherence measures
  the logical and orderly presentation of ideas in a response, allowing the reader
  to easily follow and understand the writer's train of thought. A coherent response
  directly addresses the question with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs,
  using appropriate transitions and a logical sequence of ideas. |\n| How does it
  work? | The coherence metric is calculated by instructing a language model to follow
  the definition (in the description) and a set of grading rubrics, evaluate the user
  inputs, and output a score on a 5-point scale (higher means better quality). Learn
  more about our [definition and grading rubrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in?tabs=warning#ai-assisted-relevance).
  |\n| When to use it? |\tThe recommended scenario is generative business writing
  such as summarizing meeting notes, creating marketing materials, and drafting email.
  |\n| What does it need as input? |\tQuery, Response |\n"
