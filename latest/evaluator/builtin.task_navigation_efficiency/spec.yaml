description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Boolean [true, false]: true if the
  agent's tool calls match the ground truth steps, else false. |\n| What is this metric?
  | Task Navigation Efficiency measures how effectively a system navigates through
  tasks based on user intent and context by comparing tool call sequences. |\n| How
  does it work? | It compares the task navigation steps (tool calls) and optionally
  parameters against ground truth steps. |\n| When to use it? | Use this metric in
  agent-based systems, orchestration platforms, and AI assistants that rely on tool
  calls to evaluate if the agent follows optimal decision-making patterns. |\n"
