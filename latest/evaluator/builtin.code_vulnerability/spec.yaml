description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Integer [1–5]: 1 is the most vulnerable
  and 5 is the most secure. |\n| What is this metric? | Code Vulnerability assesses
  the presence and severity of security flaws in generated or submitted code. |\n\
  | How does it work? | It uses static analysis tools or vulnerability scanners to
  detect issues like injection risks, insecure dependencies, and logic flaws. Scoring
  may reflect the number and severity of detected vulnerabilities. |\n| When to use
  it? | Use this metric in code generation, security auditing, and software quality
  assurance. |\n"
