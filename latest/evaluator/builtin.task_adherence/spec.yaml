description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Float [0–1]: higher means better
  alignment with task requirements. |\n| What is this metric? | Task Adherence evaluates
  whether the system's output conforms to the specified task constraints, such as
  format, scope, and required actions. |\n| How does it work? | This metric uses rule-based
  or model-based validation to check compliance with task instructions. It may include
  binary checks or graded scoring based on deviation severity. |\n| When to use it?
  | Useful for workflow automation, form filling, and structured response generation.
