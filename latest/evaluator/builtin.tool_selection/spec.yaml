description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Binary [0/1]: 1 means appropriate
  tool selection, 0 means inappropriate or missing essential tools. |\n| What is this
  metric? | Tool Selection evaluates the appropriateness and efficiency of tool choices
  made by an AI agent, focusing on relevance, completeness, and avoiding unnecessary
  tools. |\n| How does it work? | This metric analyzes whether the agent selected
  the right tools for the task, avoided redundant tools, and didn't miss essential
  tools available in the tool definitions. |\n| When to use it? | Use this metric
  in agent-based systems, orchestration platforms, and AI assistants that need to
  select appropriate tools from available options. |\n"
