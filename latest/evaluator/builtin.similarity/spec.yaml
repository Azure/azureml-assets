description: "Measures how closely two pieces of text resemble each other in meaning.
  Higher scores indicate greater semantic similarity. Itâ€™s best used for NLP tasks
  with a user query. Use it when you want an objective evaluation of an AI model's
  performance, particularly in text generation tasks where you have access to ground
  truth responses."
