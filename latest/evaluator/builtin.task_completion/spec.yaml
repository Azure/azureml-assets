description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Boolean [True/False]: True means
  task was successfully completed, False means task failed or not completed. |\n|
  What is this metric? | Task Completion evaluates whether an AI agent successfully
  completed the requested task based on the final outcome and deliverable quality.
  |\n| How does it work? | This metric analyzes the conversation history and agent
  response to determine if all task requirements were met and a usable deliverable
  was provided. It focuses solely on completion status, not adherence or intent understanding.
  |\n| When to use it? | Use this metric to assess agent effectiveness in task-oriented
  scenarios, workflow automation, and goal-oriented AI interactions. |\n| What does
  it need as input? | Query, Response, Tool Definitions (optional) |\n"
