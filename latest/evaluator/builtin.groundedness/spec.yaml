description: "| \t| |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range |\tInteger [1-5]: 1 is the lowest
  quality and 5 is the highest quality. |\n| What is this metric? | Groundedness measures
  how well the generated response aligns with the given context in a retrieval-augmented
  generation scenario, focusing on its relevance and accuracy with respect to the
  context. If a query is present in the input, the recommended scenario is question
  and answering. Otherwise, the recommended scenario is summarization. |\n| How does
  it work? | The groundedness metric is calculated by instructing a language model
  to follow the definition and a set of grading rubrics, evaluate the user inputs,
  and output a score on a 5-point scale (higher means better quality). Learn more
  about our [definition and grading rubrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in?tabs=warning#groundedness).
  |\n| When to use it? |\tThe recommended scenario is retrieval-augmented generation
  (RAG) scenarios, including question and answering and summarization. Use the groundedness
  metric when you need to verify that AI-generated responses align with and are validated
  by the provided context. It's essential for applications where contextual accuracy
  is key, like information retrieval, question and answering, and summarization. This
  metric ensures that the AI-generated answers are well-supported by the context.|\n\
