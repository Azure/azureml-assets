  The pysentimiento library is an open-source tool for non-commercial use and scientific research purposes, used for Sentiment Analysis and Social NLP tasks. It was trained on about 40k tweets from the SemEval 2017 corpus, using the BERTweet - a RoBERTa model trained on English tweets and processes POS, NEG, and NEU labels. The Github repository link is https://github.com/finiteautomata/pysentimiento/  While using this model, it is important to keep in mind that they are trained with third-party datasets and are subject to their respective licenses.Additionally Publication details are also mentioned.
