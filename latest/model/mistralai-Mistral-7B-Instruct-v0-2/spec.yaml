  The Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) is an instruct fine-tuned version of the Mistral-7B-v0.2.

  Mistral-7B-v0.2 has the following changes compared to Mistral-7B-v0.1:
  - 32k context window (vs 8k context in v0.1)
  - Rope-theta = 1e6
  - No Sliding-Window Attention

  For full details of this model please read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825) and [release blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/la-plateforme/).


  This instruction model is based on Mistral-7B-v0.1, a transformer model with the following architecture choices:
  - Grouped-Query Attention
  - Sliding-Window Attention
  - Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer

  # Limitations and Biases

  The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. 
  It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to
  make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs.
