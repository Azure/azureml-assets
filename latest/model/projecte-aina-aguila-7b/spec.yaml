  ## Model description

  **Ǎguila-7B** is a transformer-based causal language model for Catalan, Spanish, and English. It is based on the Falcon-7B model and has been trained on a 26B token trilingual corpus collected from publicly available corpora and crawlers.

  For more details, take a look at [this blogpost](https://medium.com/@mpamies247/flor-6-3b-a-chinchilla-compliant-model-for-catalan-spanish-and-english-7cdb389a9aac) about the project.

  More information available in the following post from Medium.com: [Introducing Ǎguila, a new open-source LLM for Spanish and Catalan](https://medium.com/@mpamies247/introducing-a%CC%8Cguila-a-new-open-source-llm-for-spanish-and-catalan-ee1ebc70bc79)

  ## Intended uses and limitations

  The **Ǎguila-7B** model is ready-to-use only for causal language modeling to perform text-generation tasks. However, it is intended to be fine-tuned for downstream tasks.

  ## How to use
  ```python
  import torch
  from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

  input_text = "El mercat del barri és fantàstic, hi pots trobar"

  model_id  = "projecte-aina/aguila-7b"
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
  generator = pipeline(
      "text-generation",
      model=model_id,
      tokenizer=tokenizer,
      torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
      trust_remote_code=True,
      device_map="auto",
  )
  generation = generator(
      input_text,
      do_sample=True,
      top_k=10,
      eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
  )

  print(f"Result: {generation[0]['generated_text']}")
  ```

  ## Limitations and bias
  At the time of submission, no measures have been taken to estimate the bias and toxicity embedded in the model. However, we are well aware that our models may be biased since the corpora have been collected using crawling techniques on multiple web sources. We intend to conduct research in these areas in the future, and if completed, this model card will be updated.


  ## Training

  ### Language adaptation and training

  The original Falcon-7B model was adapted to Spanish and Catalan by swapping the tokenizer and adjusting the embedding layer.

  ### Training data

  The training corpus consists of 26B tokens of several corpora gathered from web crawlings and public domain data.

  | Dataset             | Language | Words (per-epoch) | Epochs       |
  |---------------------|----------|--------------------|--------------|

  | Vilaweb             | ca       |             50.34M |  2.142216727 |

  The dataset has the following language distribution:

  | Language             | Percentage |
  |----------------------|------------|
  | En                   | 16.84%     |
  | Es                   | 41.38%     |
  | Ca                   | 41.79%     |


  ### Languages

  The training data has the same amount of Catalan and Spanish texts, and a smaller amount of English data. 
  The table below shows the final language distribution:

  |Language|Percentage|
  |--------|----------|
  |   English (EN)   |  16.84%  |
  |   Spanish (ES)   |  41.38%  |
  |   Catalan (CA)   |  41.79%  |

  Note: A small amount of English data was kept to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

  ### Training procedure

  The training corpus has been tokenized using a byte version of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) with a vocabulary size of 50,257 tokens. After training a new tokenizer and adapting falcon-7b's embedding layer, the model was further pre-trained in three target languages: Catalan, Spanish and English.

  The training lasted a total of 320 hours on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs with 80GB RAM.
