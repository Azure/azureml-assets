  # Model Overview

  Arctic is a dense-MoE Hybrid transformer architecture pre-trained from scratch by the Snowflake AI Research Team. We are releasing model checkpoints for both the base and instruct-tuned versions of Arctic under an Apache-2.0 license. This means you can use them freely in your own research, prototypes, and products. Please see our blog [Snowflake Arctic: The Best LLM for Enterprise AI — Efficiently Intelligent, Truly Open](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/arctic-open-efficient-foundation-language-models-snowflake) for more information on Arctic and links to other relevant resources such as our series of cookbooks covering topics around training your own custom MoE models, how to produce high-quality training data, and much more.

  - **Inputs:** Models input text only.
  - **Output:** Models generate text and code only.
  - **Model Architecture:** Arctic combines a 10B dense transformer model with a residual 128x3.66B MoE MLP resulting in 480B total and 17B active parameters chosen using a top-2 gating. For more details about Arctic's model Architecture, training process, data, etc. [see our series of cookbooks](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/arctic/cookbook/).
  - **License:** Apache-2.0.
  - **Model developers:** Snowflake AI Research Team.

  ## Training Data
  Snowflake Arctic was pretrained on 3.5 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available  datasets.
