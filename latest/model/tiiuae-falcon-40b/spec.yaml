  # Description
  Falcon-40B is a large language model (LLM) developed by the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) with 40 billion parameters. It is a causal decoder-only model trained on 1 trillion tokens from the RefinedWeb dataset, enhanced with curated corpora. Falcon-40B supports English, German, Spanish, and French languages, with limited capabilities in Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, Czech, and Swedish. It is available under the Apache 2.0 license.

  Falcon-40B is considered the best open-source model currently available, optimized for inference with features such as FlashAttention and multiquery. However, it is recommended to fine-tune the model for specific use cases.

  The training of Falcon-40B involved using 384 A100 40GB GPUs and took two months. The model carries biases and stereotypes encountered online and requires appropriate precautions for production use. It is suggested to finetune the model for specific tasks and consider guardrails. The technical specifications, training details, and evaluation results are provided in the summary.

  ## Training Details

  ### Training Data

  Falcon-40B was trained on 1,000B tokens of [RefinedWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb), a high-quality filtered and deduplicated web dataset which we enhanced with curated corpora. Significant components from our curated copora were inspired by The Pile ([Gao et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027)). 

  | **Data source**    | **Fraction** | **Tokens** | **Sources**                       |

  | _Polish_     | 4%                                | 3B         |
  | _Dutch_      | 4%                                | 3B         |
  | _Romanian_   | 3%                                | 2B         |

  | _Swedish_    | 2%                                | 1B         |


  The data was tokenized with the Falcon-[7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b)/[40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) tokenizer.

  ### Training Procedure 

  Falcon-40B was trained on 384 A100 40GB GPUs, using a 3D parallelism strategy (TP=8, PP=4, DP=12) combined with ZeRO.

  ## Technical Specifications 

  ### Model Architecture and Objective

  Falcon-40B is a causal decoder-only model trained on a causal language modeling task (i.e., predict the next token).

  The architecture is broadly adapted from the GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)), with the following differences:

  * **Positionnal embeddings:** rotary ([Su et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864));
  * **Attention:** multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)) and FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135));
  * **Decoder-block:** parallel attention/MLP with a two layer norms.

  For multiquery, we are using an internal variant which uses independent key and values per tensor parallel degree.
