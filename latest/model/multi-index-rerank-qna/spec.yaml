description: |-
  This "Multi-Source Rerank Q&A" demonstrates Q&A application, enabled by reranking data from multiple sources and powered by GPT. It utilizes indexed files and the rerank tool from Azure Machine Learning to provide grounded answers. You can ask a wide range of questions and receive responses based on a wide set of stored data. The process involves taking the query, extracting pre-existing documents across multiple sources, reranking said documents for the most relevant context, and then using GPT to chat with you, given those documents.

  ### Sample inputs and outputs (for real-time inference)

  #### Sample input
  ```json
  {
      "inputs": {
          "query": "How to use SDK V2?"
      }
  }
  ```

  #### Sample output
  ```json
  {
      "outputs": {
          "answer": "To use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2, you need to have an Azure Machine Learning workspace and the SDK installed. You can either create a compute instance, which automatically installs the SDK and is pre-configured for ML workflows, or use the provided commands to install the SDK.
