    ## Quickstart

    First install the model:

    ```bash
    pip install microsoft-aurora
    ```

    Then you can make predictions with a Azure Foundry AI endpoint as follows:

    ```python
    from aurora import Batch

    from aurora.foundry import BlobStorageChannel, FoundryClient, submit


    initial_condition = Batch(...)  # Create initial condition for the model.

    for pred in submit(
        initial_condition,
        model_name="aurora-0.25-finetuned",
        num_steps=4,  # Every step predicts six hours ahead.
        foundry_client=FoundryClient(
            endpoint="https://endpoint/",
            token="ENDPOINT_TOKEN",
        ),
        # Communication with the endpoint happens via an intermediate blob storage container. You
        # will need to create one and generate an URL with a SAS token that has both read and write
        # rights.
        channel=BlobStorageChannel(
            "https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container?<READ_WRITE_SAS_TOKEN>"
        ),
    ):
        pass  # Do something with `pred`, which is a `Batch`.
    ```

    ## Responsible AI Transparency Documentation

    An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who will use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it is deployed.
    Creating a system that is fit for its intended purpose requires an understanding of how the technology works, its capabilities and limitations, and how to achieve the best performance.
    Microsoft has a broad effort to put our AI principles into practice.

    To find out more, see [Responsible AI principles from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai).

    ### Limitations

    Although Aurora was trained to accurately predict future weather, air pollution, and ocean waves,
    Aurora is based on neural networks, which means that there are no strict guarantees that predictions will always be accurate.
    Altering the inputs, providing a sample that was not in the training set,
    or even providing a sample that was in the training set but is simply unlucky may result in arbitrarily poor predictions.
    In addition, even though Aurora was trained on a wide variety of data sets,
    it is possible that Aurora inherits biases present in any one of those data sets.
    A forecasting system like Aurora is only one piece of the puzzle in a weather prediction pipeline,
    and its outputs are not meant to be directly used by people or businesses to plan their operations.
    A series of additional verification tests are needed before it can become operationally useful.

    ### Data

    The models included in the code have been trained on a variety of publicly available data.
    A description of all data, including download links, can be found in [Supplementary C of the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13063).
    The checkpoints include data from ERA5, CMCC, IFS-HR, HRES T0, GFS T0 analysis, and GFS forecasts.

  evaluation: |
    All versions of Aurora were extensively evaluated by evaluating predictions on data not seen during training.
    These evaluations not only compare measures of accuracy, such as the root mean square error and anomaly correlation coefficient,
    but also look at the behaviour in extreme situations, like extreme heat and cold, and rare events, like Storm Ciarán in 2023.
    These evaluations are the main topic of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13063).

description: |
  Aurora is a machine learning model that can predict general environmental variables, such as temperature and wind speed.
  It is a _foundation model_, which means that it was first generally trained on a lot of data,
  and then can be adapted to specialised environmental forecasting tasks with relatively little data.
  We provide four such specialised versions:
  one for medium-resolution weather prediction,
  one for high-resolution weather prediction,
  one for air pollution prediction,
  and one for ocean wave prediction.
  Currently, this implementation only includes the version for medium-term weather prediction.
  Please see the documentation of the Aurora Foundry Python API linked below for
  precisely which models are available.
