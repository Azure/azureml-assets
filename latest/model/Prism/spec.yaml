  PRISM is a multi-modal generative foundation model for slide-level analysis of H&E-stained histopathology images. Utilizing Virchow tile embeddings and clinical report texts for pre-training, PRISM combines these embeddings into a single slide embedding and generates a text-based diagnostic report. These can be used for tasks such as cancer detection, sub-typing, and biomarker identification. The model's slide encoder can be fine-tuned for specific classification tasks, leveraging both image and text data to enhance diagnostic performance and robustness.
  This model is available solely for non-commercial research and evaluation purposes. It is not designed for clinical use and should not be employed to diagnose any diseases. The reports generated by PRISM are intended for assessing the model's quality and may contain errors. Therefore, using the generated reports in clinical settings is strictly prohibited. The generated reports do not reflect the model's true performance for zero-shot or finetuning benchmark diagnostic tasks.

  PRISM supports several modes of use:

  •	text report generation to describe tissue in H&E whole slide images
  •	zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing using text prompts
  •	adaptation to new tasks via PRISM finetuning, or linear classifier on the slide embedding

  ## Model Usage

  **Direct use**
  PRISM is a vision-language model that can analyze whole slide images using the following methods:

  •	CLIP-style zero-shot classification via zero_shot method, or
  •	generate a tissue description in the image via generate method.

  The model takes whole slide images in the form of tile embeddings from our Virchow model. Please see https://huggingface.co/paige-ai/Virchow for instructions on how to use it to generate embeddings for your whole slide image.

  **Downstream use**
  You can use PRISM to compute slide embedding for downstream tasks such as slide-level classification. The slide embedding can be further adapted to new tasks by finetuning the slide encoder of PRISM on slide-level labels, e.g. biomarkers.

  Slide embeddings are accessible via slide_representations method.
