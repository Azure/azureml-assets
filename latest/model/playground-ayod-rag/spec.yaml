  The "Playground AYOD (Add your own data)" is a RAG Flow representation of Azure AI Playground - Add your own data experience, enhanced by Azure Open AI LLM, that leverages your personally indexed data and chat history to deliver more cohesive and relevant answers. It involves processing the raw query to generate more relevant user query based on chat history context using LLM, followed by a Search Index Look up tool to pinpoint the most pertinent context within the user's data. Subsequently, LLM is employed to generate a comprehensive answer to the question using the sourced documents and chat history context.

I've used them extensively on multiple hiking trips, and they have never let me down. The grip on various surfaces is exceptional, providing stability even on slippery trails.

On the positive side, they offer decent support and have good traction on most terrains. However, I found the sizing to be slightly off, and the shoes took a bit of breaking in before they felt comfortable. Also, while they are durable overall, I noticed some minor wear and tear on the outsole after a few months of regular use. They are a decent choice for occasional hikers but may not be ideal for intense or prolonged expeditions.\\\\n\\\\n4) <strong>Rating:</strong> 4\\\\n <strong>Review:</strong> I purchased the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes for a hiking trip in rugged mountain terrain. They performed admirably, providing excellent stability and protection. The waterproofing feature kept my feet dry during unexpected rain showers. The shoes are also lightweight, which is a bonus for long hikes. However, I did notice a small amount of discomfort around the toe area after extended periods of walking. Nevertheless, these shoes are a reliable option for most hiking adventures.\\\\n\\\\n5) <strong>Rating:</strong> 5\\\\n <strong>Review:</strong> The TrailWalker Hiking Shoes are hands down the best hiking shoes I've ever owned. From the moment I put them on, they felt like a perfect fit. The traction is outstanding, allowing me to confidently navigate challenging trails without slipping. The shoes provide excellent ankle support, which is crucial on uneven terrain. They are also durable and showno signs of wear, even after multiple hikes. I can't recommend these shoes enough for avid hikers. They are worth every penny.\\\\n\\\\n## FAQ\\\\n49) How long does it take to break in the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes?\\\\n The TrailWalker Hiking Shoes are made of flexible synthetic materials, so they usually take just a few days of regular use to break in and feel comfortable on your feet.\\\\n\\\\n50) Are the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes suitable for trail running?\\\\n While the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes are designed primarily for hiking, their lightweight construction and excellent traction also make them suitable for trail running on moderate terrains.\\\\n\\\\n51) Do the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes provide good arch support?\\\\n Yes, the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes feature a cushioned midsole and supportive insole, providing excellent arch support for long hikes and reducing foot fatigue.\\\\n\\\\n52) Are the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes compatible with gaiters?\\\\n Yes, the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes can be used with most standard gaiters, providing additional protection against water, snow, and debris while hiking.\\\\n\\\\n53) Can the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes be resoled?\\\\n While it may be possible to resole the TrailWalker Hiking Shoes, we recommend contacting the manufacturer (TrekReady) or a professional shoe repair service to determine the feasibility and cost of resoling.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"</p>\"}}, {\"[doc1]\": {\"title\": \"\\\"# Information about product item_number: 11\\\\nTrailWalker Hiking Shoes, price $110\\\\n\\\\n## Brand\\\\nTrekReady\\\\n\\\\n## Category\\\\nHiking Footwear\\\\n\\\\n## Featur\", \"content\": \"<p>Exclusions:\\\\n - The warranty does not cover damage resulting from misuse, neglect, accidents, improper care, or unauthorized repairs.\\\\n - Normal wear and tear, including worn outsoles, laces, or minor cosmetic imperfections, are not covered under the warranty.\\\\n - Modifications or alterations made to the shoes will void the warranty.\\\\n\\\\n4.
