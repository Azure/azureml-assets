description: |
  The dolly-v2-12b model is a large, instruction-following language model created by Databricks, Inc. and is licensed for commercial use. It is based on EleutherAI’s Pythia-12b and was trained on a 15,000-record instruction corpus generated by Databricks employees, which was released under a CC-BY-SA license. It is not a state-of-the-art model, but it does exhibit high-quality instruction-following behavior that is not characteristic of the foundation model on which it is based.

  #### Sample output
  ```json
  [
    {
      "0": "Nuclear fission and fusion are the 2 main ways that the nucleus of an atom can change. Nuclear fission occurs when a nucleus splits into 2 or more pieces. Nuclear fusion occurs when 2 or more nuclei join together to make a much larger nucleus.\n\nBoth nuclear fission and nuclear fusion take a lot of energy. For fission, you need to melt the nucleus to allow for the pieces to separate. For fusion, you need to sustain temperatures over 10 million degrees Celsius in order to combine 2 nuclei together.\n\nNuclear fission is how nuclear power plants create electricity. Nuclear fission involves using high-energy radiation to split a nucleus in 2 pieces. The pieces become unstable and quickly decay to release energy.\n\nNuclear fusion involves combining 2 or more nuclei of different elements into one new one. For this to happen, the nuclei need to be brought close together but kept apart by the enormous energies needed for nuclear fusion. In this process, a small amount of energy is released that can be converted to electricity. Nuclear fusion is how stars create the light and heat we feel from the sun.\n\nHuman beings can control which process happens in a nuclear reactor. We use catalysts to cause nuclear fission or nuclear fusion to happen.\n\nFusion happens naturally in the"
