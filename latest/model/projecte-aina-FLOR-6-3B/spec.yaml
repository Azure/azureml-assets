  ## Model description

  **FLOR-6.3B** is a 6.3B-parameter transformer-based causal language model for Catalan, Spanish, and English. 
  It is the result of a language adaptation technique performed on [BLOOM-7.1B](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-7b1), 
  which involves modifying the model's vocabulary and embedding layer, and continuously pre-training the model with 140B tokens in our target languages.

  For more details, take a look at [this blogpost](https://medium.com/@mpamies247/flor-6-3b-a-chinchilla-compliant-model-for-catalan-spanish-and-english-7cdb389a9aac) about the project.

  ## Intended uses and limitations

  The **FLOR-6.3B** model is ready-to-use only for causal language modeling. 
  It can perform text-generation tasks and be fine-tuned for specific scenarios.

  ## How to use
  ```python
  import torch
  from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

  input_text = "Sovint em trobo pensant en tot allò que"

  model_id  = "projecte-aina/FLOR-6.3B"
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
  generator = pipeline(
      "text-generation",
      model=model_id,
      tokenizer=tokenizer,
      torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
      trust_remote_code=True,
      device_map="auto",
  )
  generation = generator(
      input_text,
      do_sample=True,
      top_k=10,
      eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
  )

  print(f"Result: {generation[0]['generated_text']}")
  ```

  ## Limitations and bias
  At the time of submission, no measures have been taken to estimate the bias and toxicity embedded in the model. 
  However, we are well aware that our models may be biased since the corpora have been collected using crawling techniques 
  on multiple web sources. We intend to conduct research in these areas in the future, and if completed, this model card will be updated. 


  ## Training

  ### Language adaptation and training

  The language adaptation technique used to create FLOR-6.3B requires the vocabulary of the source model 
  to be adapted before continuing its pre-training with data in the target languages. Specifically, we proceeded as follows:
  1) We trained our own BPE tokenizer for Catalan, Spanish, and English, and replaced the original BLOOM tokenizer and vocabulary with it. This procedure implied a downsizing of the original BLOOM's embedding layer and, therefore, a model compression from 7.1B parameters to 6.3B.
  2) The embeddings corresponding to tokens that are present in both the original and the target vocabulary (matching tokens) were used for initialization.
  3) The embeddings from tokens not present in BLOOM's original vocabulary were initialized as the average of all embeddings.
  4) The model was initialized with the weights from BLOOM-7.1B, and with our adapted tokenizer (step 1) and embeddings (steps 2-3).
  5) The model was then trained on a corpus that contains a mixture of Catalan, Spanish, and English data.

  ### Training data

  The training corpus is composed of 140B tokens gathered from web crawlings and public domain data. Most of the sources in Catalan have been obtained from the [CATalog 1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/projecte-aina/CATalog) dataset, filtered with a minimum threshold of 0.6 and oversampling some of the sources it integrates to different extents.

  ### Languages

  The training data has the same amount of Catalan, Spanish, and English texts. 
  The table below shows the final language distribution:

  |Language|Percentage|
  |--------|----------|
  |   Catalan (CA)   |  33.39%  |
  |   Spanish (ES)   |  33.32%  |
  |   English (EN)   |  33.29%  |

  ### Framework
  The training was conducted in 16 Cerebras' [CS-2 systems](https://www.cerebras.net/product-system/) 
  using the [cs-2.0.2](https://github.com/Cerebras/modelzoo/releases/tag/Release_2.0.2) release of their software.

  ## Evaluation
  FLOR-6.3B has been evaluated in a 5-shot setting, using EleutherAI's *LM Evaluation Harness*. 
  The evaluation benchmark includes tasks in Catalan, Spanish, and English, with particular emphasis on Catalan datasets.

  The tasks were chosen to cover several evaluation areas in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the model's capabilities. 
  The baselines used to compare our results are multilingual and English open-source 7B models and smaller models of the FLOR family of models: **TBC**.

  Our implementation of EleutherAI's *LM Evaluation Harness* can be found [here](https://github.com/langtech-bsc/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/FLOR-eval).
