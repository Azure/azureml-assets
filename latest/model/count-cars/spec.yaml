description: |-
  The "Count Cars" is a model designed for accurately quantifying the number of specific vehicles – particularly red cars – in given images. Utilizing the advanced capabilities of Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, this system meticulously analyzes each image, identifies and counts red cars, outputting the results in a clear JSON format. The process involves aggregating the counts from multiple images to provide a cumulative total, offering a precise and efficient approach to vehicle analysis.
