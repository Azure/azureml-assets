description: |
  Virchow2 is a self-supervised vision transformer pretrained using 3.1M whole slide histopathology images. The model can be used as a tile-level feature extractor (frozen or finetuned) to achieve state-of-the-art results for a wide variety of downstream computational pathology use cases.

  **Disclaimer**
  Virchow2 has been developed for research purposes and is not intended for diagnosis of real patients or projection/prediction of future disease possibilities.

  Fairness evaluation cannot be completed due to limitations in the metadata. Underlying biases of the training datasets may not be well characterized and may not be representative of all demographics.

      ],
      "index":[0],
      "data": [
        ["image1"]
     ]
   }
  }
  ```
  Note:
  - "image1" and "image2" should be publicly accessible urls or strings in base64 format.
