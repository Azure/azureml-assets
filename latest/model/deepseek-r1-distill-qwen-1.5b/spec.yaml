  This model is an optimized version of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B for local inference. Optimized models are published here in ONNX format to run on CPU, GPU, and NPU across devices, including server platforms, Windows, Linux and Mac desktops, and mobile CPUs, with the precision best suited to each of these targets.

  # ONNX Models
  Here are some of the optimized configurations we have added:
  1.	ONNX model for CPU and mobile using RTN quantization.
  2.	ONNX model for GPU using RTN quantization.
  3.	ONNX model for NPU using QuaRot and GPTQ quantization.

  # Model Description
  - **Developed by:** Microsoft
  - **Model type:** ONNX
  - **License:** MIT
  - **Model Description:** This is a conversion of the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B for local inference.
  - **Disclaimer:** Model is only an optimization of the base model, any risk associated with the model is the responsibility of the user of the model. Please verify and test for your scenarios. There may be a slight difference in output from the base model with the optimizations applied. Note that optimizations applied are distinct from fine tuning and thus do not alter the intended uses or capabilities of the model.
