description: |-
  Virchow is a self-supervised vision transformer pretrained using 1.5M whole slide histopathology images. The model can be used as a tile-level feature extractor (frozen or finetuned) to achieve state-of-the-art results for a wide variety of downstream computational pathology use cases.

  ## Sample Input and Output (for real-time inference)
  ### Sample Input

  ```json
  {
    "input_data": {
      "columns": [
        "image"
      ],
      "index":[0],
      "data": [
        ["image1"]
     ]
   }
  }
  ```
  Note:
  - "image1" and "image2" should be publicly accessible urls or strings in base64 format.

  ### Sample Output
  ```json
  [
    {
      "output": [
        0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```
  Output will be image embeddings.
