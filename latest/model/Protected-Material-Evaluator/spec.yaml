  ## Definition

  Protected material is any text that is under copyright, including song lyrics, recipes, and articles. Protected material evaluation leverages the Azure AI Content Safety Protected Material for Text service to perform the classification.

  ## Labeling

  Protected Material evaluations annotate content using boolean labels of True (protected material was detected) and False (no protected material was detected), along with AI-generated reasoning for the label.
