  The Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 Large Language Model (LLM) is an instruct fine-tuned version of the Mistral-7B-v0.3.

  Mistral-7B-v0.3 has the following changes compared to [Mistral-7B-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2/edit/main/README.md)
  - Extended vocabulary to 32768
  - Supports v3 Tokenizer
  - Supports function calling

  # Limitations and Biases

  The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. 
  It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs.
