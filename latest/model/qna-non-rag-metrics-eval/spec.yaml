  The Q&A evaluation flow will evaluate the Q&A systems by leveraging the state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLM) to measure the quality and safety of your responses. Utilizing GPT and GPT embedding model to assist with measurements aims to achieve a high agreement with human evaluations compared to traditional mathematical measurements.

  ### Sample inputs and outputs (for real-time inference)

  #### Sample input
  ```json
  {
      "inputs": {
          "question": "Which camping table holds the most weight?",
          "answer": "The Alpine Explorer Tent is the most waterproof.",
          "context": "From the our product list, the alpine explorer tent is the most waterproof. The Adventure Dining Tabbe has higher weight.",
          "ground_truth": "The Alpine Explorer Tent has the highest rainfly waterproof rating at 3000m",
          "metrics": "gpt_groundedness,f1_score,ada_similarity,gpt_fluency,gpt_coherence,gpt_similarity,gpt_relevance"
      }
  }
  ```

  #### Sample output
