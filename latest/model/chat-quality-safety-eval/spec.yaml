description: |-
  The chat quality and safety evaluation flow will evaluate the chat systems by leveraging the state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLM) to measure the quality and safety of your LLM responses . Utilizing GPT model to assist with measurements aims to achieve a high agreement with human evaluations compared to traditional mathematical measurements.
