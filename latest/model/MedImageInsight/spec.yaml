  ### Overview
  Most medical imaging AI today is narrowly built to detect a small set of individual findings on a single modality like Chest x-Rays. 
  This training approach is data and computationally inefficient, requiring ~6-12 months per finding, and often fails to generalize in real world environments. 
  By further training existing multimodal foundation models on medical images and associated text data, Microsoft and Nuance created a multimodal foundation model that shows evidence of generalizing across various medical imaging modalities, anatomies, locations, severities, and types of medical data. 
  The training methods learn to map the medical text and images into a unified numerical vector representation space, which makes it easy for computers to understand the relationships between those modalities. 

  Embeddings is an important building block in AI research and development for retrieval, search, comparison, classification, and tagging tasks, and developers and researchers can now use MedImageInsight embeddings in the medical domain. 
  MedImageInsight embeddings is open source allowing developers to customize and adapt to their specific use cases.

  ### Model Architecture

  Microsoft MedImageInsight includes 360 million parameter image encoder and 252 million parameter language encoder and comes as pretrained model with fine-tuning capability. The language encoder is not run in inference for each image. It is only run once (offline) to generate classifier head. MedImageInsight is a vision language transformer and was derviced from the Florence computer vision foundation model. Florence is a two-tower architecture similar to CLIP, except the DaViT archictecture is used as the image encoder and the UniCL objective is used as the objective function for MedImageInsight. 

  Model input supports image and text input and generates vector embeddings as output. This is a static model trained on an offline dataset that is described below.

  ### Training information

  | **Training Dataset**   | **Details**        | 
  |----------------|---------------------|
  | **[MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/)**  | Frontal chest X-rays from the training partition of the MIMIC-CXR dataset and the associated text reports. Rule-based processing was carried out to extract findings and impressions separately, or to map non-labeled report sections to the relevant sections. During training, text is randomly sampled from either the findings or the impression section. In total 203,170 images from this dataset were used.|
  | **[NIH-CXR-LT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36318048/)**| The NIH-CXR-LT dataset contains long tail distribution categories spanning 20 disease classes for frontal chest X-rays. 68,058 images from the training dataset were leveraged.      | 
  | **[IRMA 2009](https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/113524/files/Lehmann_IRMACode_2003.pdf)**  | A dataset containing X-rays covering a spectrum of body regions, views, and patient positions. Category information is specified in a coding system, with a PDF mapping the coding system to text for each of the code sub-parts. We converted the coding scheme to the text counterparts by extracting this mapping from the PDF, and leveraged the image and code-text pairs for training.      | 
  | **[RSNA BoneAge](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2018180736?journalCode=radiology)**  | Pediatric bone-age hand X-rays annotated with the development age of the images. The images are supplied in 8-bit format with inconsistent window leveling. Preprocessing was applied including histogram equalization followed by window leveling to control and standardize the appearance of the images for subsequent training and inference. The development age and gender of the image was converted to text using a standardized template. 12,611 images from the training partition are leveraged. |     
  | **[UPENN](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01560-7)**  | A dataset of MRI images of glioblastomas. Images were paired with the text of their DICOM image series descriptions. In total 4,645 images with associated texts were organized for training. |      
  | **[TCGA](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/tcga-sarc/)**  | multi-modal dataset of imaging for sarcoma diagnostics. CT and MRI images were extracted and associated with the text of their series description, constituting 5,643 image and text pairs. |    
  | **[SD198](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4_13)**  | A dataset of clinical photographs of 198 skin lesions crawled from the web. Train and test splits were not made available but based on random 50% sampling, which we followed for consistency, yielding 3,253 images for training. | 
  | **[ISIC2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03368)**  | A collection of dermascopic images of skin lesions, associated with 8 diagnostic states spanning metastatic and non-metastatic disease. 20,268 images from the training partition were leveraged. | 
  | **[PatchCamelyon](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2665774)**  | Histopathological images of breast tissue depicting the presence or absence of cancer. 262,144 images and associated text labels were used in training.  | 
  | **[RSNA Mammography](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection/data)**  | Images from RSNA hosted and managed challenge on breast cancer detection from mammography. The dataset comprises several styles of mammo- grams with varying window levels and contrasts. No attempt was made to standardize or normalize the images. In total, 43,764 mammograms were leveraged for training. |
  | **[LIDIC-IDRI](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/lung-image-database-consortium-image-collection-lidc-idri)**  | A dataset of chest CTs depicting lung nodules at various stages of development. Dataset was broken into tiles of 5x5 across images, with tiles labeled for the maturity of lung nodule present in the tile. 80,201 tiles were sampled for training. |  
  | **[PAD-UFES-20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479321/)**  | A collection of clinical photographs of skin lesions taken from mo- bile devices, where the images have been cropped over the lesion of interest. 6 diseases are represented. According to precedent 2,065 images (90%) were leveraged for training, and 233 (10%) for testing.  |  
  | **[ODIR-5k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k)**  | Fundus images, where pairs of eyes were annotated across 6 categories. If one eye is not normal, the pair is labeled with the disease of the abnormal eye. Laterality specific textual descriptions were also available. Upon further processing, we discovered about 79 unique textual descriptions were assigned across 6,495 unique eyes, and opted to use these descriptions as labels instead of the reduced 6 labels. 5228 images were used for training, and 1267 images were used for evaluation, which constituted a random 20% sampling of the top 30 categories (with 10 or more instances in the dataset). |  
  | **Propiertary datasets**  | Multiple other proprietary datasets, composed of procured data, data supplied by collaborative partners, and data crawled from the web were additionally leveraged for training. Caution was taken to ensure there was no leakage of test data samples in the crawled data used for training. |  


  | **Carbon Footprint**                          | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                 |
  |---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **Carbon Footprint**                  | Pretraining utilized a cumulative 7680 GPU hours of computation on hardware of type V100 (TDP of 250W-400W). Estimated total emissions were 0.89184 tCO2eq. We trained on Azure Machine Learning. We used 64 V100 GPUs. Compute region was West US 2. |
