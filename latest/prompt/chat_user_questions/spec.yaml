description: >
  To submit your application to evaluation, you can ask
  a language model to generate synthetic questions for you.
  Use this prompt as a basis to generate a set of questions
  on a product for a given context and user persona.
  Using this technique, you can create an evaluation
  dataset, to measure the quality of your application
  responses on more than just a few manual samples.

  Example input:
  ```
  - context: contoso outdoors shopping website
  - persona: a confused customer, not proficient in web interfaces
  - product: hiking boots
  ```

  Example output:
  ```json
  {"question":"How do I find the right size of hiking boots for my feet on this website?"}
  {"question":"Are there instructions available for how to measure my foot for the
  correct boot fit?"}
  {"question":"Can someone guide me through the process of selecting a pair of hiking
  boots?"}
  ```
