  # [ { "messages": [ { "content": "how can identity protection services help protect me against identity theft", "role": "user" }, { "content": "Identity protection services can help protect you against identity theft in several ways:\n\n1. Monitoring: Many identity protection services monitor your credit reports, public records, and other sources for signs of identity theft. If they detect any suspicious activity, they will alert you so you can take action.\n2. Credit freeze: Some identity protection services can help you freeze your credit, which makes it more difficult for thieves to open new accounts in your name.\n3. Identity theft insurance: Some identity protection services offer insurance that can help you recover financially if you become a victim of identity theft.\n4. Assistance: Many identity protection services offer assistance if you become a victim of identity theft. They can help you file a police report, contact credit bureaus, and other steps to help you restore your identity.\n\nOverall, identity protection services can provide you with peace of mind and help you take proactive steps to protect your identity. However, it's important to note that no service can completely guarantee that you will never become a victim of identity theft. It's still important to take steps to protect your own identity, such as being cautious with personal information and regularly monitoring your credit reports.", "role": "assistant" } ] } ]

  batch_size:
    type: integer
    optional: true

  pad_to_max_length:
    type: string
    enum:
    - "true"
    - "false"
    default: "false"
    optional: true
    description: If set to True, the returned sequences will be padded according to
      the model's padding side and padding index, up to their `max_seq_length`. If
      no `max_seq_length` is specified, the padding is done up to the model's max
      length.

  max_seq_length:
    type: integer
    optional: true
    default: -1
    description: Controls the maximum length to use when pad_to_max_length parameter
      is set to `true`. Default is -1 which means the padding is done up to the model's
      max length. Else will be padded to `max_seq_length`.

  # Data inputs
  # Please note that either `train_file_path` or `train_mltable_path` needs to be passed. In case both are passed, `mltable path` will take precedence. The validation and test paths are optional and an automatic split from train data happens if they are not passed.
  # If both validation and test files are missing, 10% of train data will be assigned to each of them and the remaining 80% will be used for training
  # If anyone of the file is missing, 20% of the train data will be assigned to it and the remaining 80% will be used for training
