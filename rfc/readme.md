# Overview
RFC (Request For Comment) folder is used for creating specs that's relatively big, such as new asset proposals etc.

# New Asset Proposal Request
If you know the owning area, organize this folder by <area name>/xxx.md
In the markdown, please create a new PR answering the following questions.
* What are the assets being proposed?
* Why should this asset be built-in?
* Support model (what teams will be on the hook for bug fixes and security patches)?
* YAML spec for each asset. You can put the YAML files in their respective area folders, not necessarily in the RFC folder.
* A high-level description of the implementation for each asset.
