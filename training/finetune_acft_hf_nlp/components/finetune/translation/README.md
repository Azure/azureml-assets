# Finetune Component
This component enables finetuning of pretrained models on custom or pre-available datasets. The component supports LoRA, Deepspeed and ONNXRuntime configurations for performance enhancement. 
The components can be seen here ![as shown in the figure](https://aka.ms/azureml-ft-docs-finetune-component-images)

# 1. Inputs
1. _deepspeed_ (URI_FILE, optional)

    Input path to the deepspeed config file. This is a JSON file that can be used to configure optimizer, scheduler, batch size and other training related parameters. This is the [default deepspeed config](https://aka.ms/azureml-ft-docs-sample-deepspeed-config) used when [apply_deepspeed](#33-deepspeed-and-ort-parameters) is set to `true`. Alternatively, you can pass your custom deepspeed config. Please follow the [deepspeed docs](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/) to create the custom config.

# 4. Run Settings

This setting helps to choose the compute for running the component code. **For the purpose of finetune, gpu compute should be used**. We recommend using ND24 compute.

> Select *Use other compute target*

- Under this option, you can select either `compute_cluster` or `compute_instance` as the compute type and the corresponding instance / cluster created in your workspace.
- If you have not created the compute, you can create the compute by clicking the `Create Azure ML compute cluster` link that's available while selecting the compute. See the figure below
![other compute target](https://aka.ms/azureml-ft-docs-create-compute-target)

> Set the number of processes under Distribution subsection to use all the gpus in a node

To use all the gpus within a node, set the `Process count per instance` to number of gpus in that node

> Set the number of nodes under the Resources subsection

In case of distributed training, you can configure `instance count` under this subsection to increase the number of nodes

> **CPU** training ia also supported with the help of `MPI` as backend. Currently supported on a single node only.


# 5. Output Settings

In case of distributed training, a.k.a multi-node training, the mode must be set to `Mount` and not `Upload` as shown in the figure below
