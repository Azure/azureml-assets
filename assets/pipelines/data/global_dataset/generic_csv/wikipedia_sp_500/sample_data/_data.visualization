hitting a peak in 1926 with a net income of united states dollar us 4 9 million however in the years leading to the great depression weakness in the oil markets contributed to sluggish profits the aftermath of the market crash aggravated the unsteady oil industry in the first quarter of 1930 the company experienced a minor loss the early years of the depression was a struggle against wavering demand and overproduction in some regions later into the 1930s the financial forecast became more sanguine for amerada in december 1941 the company reorganized by merging the holding company with the principal operating subsidiary amerada petroleum corporation into a simplified operating company the new entity also adopted the former subsidiary s name robust postwar growth rocketed the company past us 100 million in sales in 1955 hess oil and chemical an oil refiner and marketer founded by leon hess acquired 10 of the company for us 100 million in 1966 after the united kingdom british government sold a stake it had amassed during world war ii albert levinson became the senior vice president and designed the hess logo hess and amerada would announce plans for a merger in december 1968 some amerada stockholders led by morton adler criticized the arrangement as being too favorable for hess adler argued amerada s oil reserves would contribute the lion s share of assets for the proposed company so amerada stockholders should retain more control of the new company before the stockholder vote on the matter conocophillips phillips petroleum an integrated oil firm approached amerada with its own merger proposal but the offer was declined in march still interested phillips nonetheless stated it would not carry out a proxy fight against the proposed hess deal hess fearing such a strategy made a cash tender offer of us 140 million for an additional 1 1 million shares of amerada which would double its holding in the company the new shares would be employed in a may stockholder vote deciding the merger s fate the vote took place amidst shareholder rancor that in addition to echoing adler s arguments objected to amerada s financing of the recently completed tender offer hess planned to cancel the shares and the cost of the acquisition would be absorbed by the newly formed company one shareholder at the meeting quipped it looks to me as if hess is buying amerada with amerada s money proponents of the deal won and the us 2 4 billion merger combining a purely production company with a refinery and marketer operation was completed however controversy was not yet extinguished by the stockholder confirmation a class action federal lawsuit in 1972 claiming the proxy vote information was misleading in 1976 a court agreed that the company falsely claimed to have considered each company s assets as a reason for the merger in 2001 amerada hess purchased triton energy limited in a cash tender deal valued at approximately us 3 2 billion triton one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the u s had earned a reputation as a maverick oil company due to its highly successful yet potentially risky overseas

nigeria to administer an experimental antibiotic trovafloxacin to approximately 200 children local kano officials report that more than 50 children died in the experiment while many others developed mental and physical deformities the nature and frequency of both fatalities and other adverse outcomes were similar to those historically found among pediatric patients treated for meningitis in sub saharan africa in 2001 families of the children as well as the governments of kano and nigeria filed lawsuits regarding the treatment representing the government is babatunde irukera according to news reports researchers did not obtain signed consent forms and medical personnel said pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug the lawsuits also accuse pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing as well as allegedly under dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of trovan pfizer denied these claims and subsequently produced an approval letter for testing from the nigerian ethics committee the nigerian government insisted that it was a fake and a panel of nigerian medical experts agreed that the letter had been concocted and backdated by the company s lead researcher in kano they went on to conclude that pfizer never obtained authorization from the nigerian government to give the unproven drug to children and infants in 2007 pfizer published a statement of defense letter the letter makes several claims including that pfizer donated 18 million in nigerian naira ngn about 216 000 in 1996 us dollars usd that the drug s oral form was presented as safer and easier to administer that the administration of trovan saved lives and that no unusual side

investigators to find evidence of corruption against the nigerian attorney general to persuade him to drop legal action washington post reporter joe stephens who helped break the story in 2000 called these actions dangerously close to blackmail gmo virus a scientist claims she was infected by a genetically modified virus while working for pfizer in her federal lawsuit she says she has been intermittently paralyzed by the pfizer designed virus mcclain of deep river suspects she was inadvertently exposed through work by a former pfizer colleague in 2002 or 2003 to an engineered form of the lentivirus a virus similar to the one that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids the court found that mcclain failed to demonstrate that her illness was caused by exposure to the lentivirus but also that pfizer violated whistleblower laws blue cross blue shield health insurance company blue cross blue shield bcbs filed a lawsuit against pfizer for reportedly illegally marketing their drugs bextra geodon and lyrica bcbs is reporting that pfizer used kickbacks and wrongly persuaded doctors to prescribe the drugs fiercepharma reported that according to the suit the drugmaker not only handed out those misleading materials on off label uses but sent doctors on caribbean junkets and paid them 2 000 honoraria in return for their listening to lectures about bextra more than 5 000 healthcare professionals were entertained at meetings in bahamas virgin islands and across the u s the suit alleges pfizer has had similar cases brought against it which it has settled with the us federal government and with more than 40 us states pfizer denies the allegations wyeth s rapamune a whistleblower suit was filed in 2005 against wyeth which was acquired by pfizer alleging that the company illegally marketed their drug rapamune wyeth is targeted in the suit for off label marketing targeting specific doctors and medical facilities to increased sales of rapamune trying to get current transplant patients to change from their current transplant drugs to rapamune and for specifically targeting african americans according to the whistleblowers wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals with kickbacks to prescribe the drug in the form of grants donations and other money a us house of representatives committee led by rep edolphus towns is currently investigating these allegations brigham young university controversy arose over the drug celebrex brigham young university byu said that a professor of chemistry dr daniel simmons discovered an enzyme in the 1990s which would later lead towards the development of celebrex byu was originally seeking 15 royalty on sales which would equate to 9 7 billion the court filings show that a research agreement was made with monsanto later acquired by pfizer to develop a better aspirin the enzyme that dr simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems which celebrex is used to reduce those issues a battle ensued lasting over six years because byu claimed that pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while pfizer claims it had met all obligations in regards to the monsanto agreement this culminated in a 450 million amicable settlement without going to trial pfizer said it would take a 450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle environmental record according to the epa pfizer is among the top ten companies in america with the most numerous emissions sources a landfill and two wastewater lagoons in ledyard ct near the pfizer

inherited wyeth s liabilities in the american cyanamid site in bridgewater new jersey this site is highly toxic and an epa declared superfund site pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses members of the surrounding communities have stated that the epa has been coerced into accepting a plan that is affordable for pfizer but is not a complete proper remediation plan for the site detrimental to the interest of the community the epa has suggested a remediation plan that includes environmental caps and redeveloping a portion of it in the future this redevelopment will occur on the site which is located within a flood plain something the epa failed to address in their feasibility study released in early 2012 the mayor of bridgewater the new jersey department of environmental protection and other key community leaders also came out to endorse the plan without considering the amount of increased flooding that is going to take place if such a plan is implemented political lobbying pfizer is a leading member of the u s global leadership coalition a washington d c based coalition of over 400 major companies and ngos that advocates for a larger international affairs budget which funds american diplomatic humanitarian and development efforts abroad pfizer is one of the single largest lobbying interests in united states politics for example in the first 9 months of 2009 pfizer spent over 16 3 nbsp million on lobbying us congressional lawmakers making them the sixth largest lobbying interest in the us following pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma which ranked fourth but also represents many of their interests a spokeswoman for pfizer said the company wanted to make sure our voice is heard in this conversation in regards to the company s expenditure of 25 nbsp million in 2010 to lobby health care reform pfizer s primary interests are opposition of congressional efforts to attach a prescription drug benefit to medicare and opposition to generic drugs entering us markets pfizer also purportedly proposed a ban on all lawsuits against manufacturing manufacturers of body implant parts which was proposed in the united states congress as part of tort reform legislation according to u s state department cables released by the whistle blowing site wikileaks pfizer lobbied against new zealand getting a free trade agreement with the united states because it objected to new zealand s restrictive drug buying rules and tried to get rid of new

instituting many metrics and centralizing operations while cutting jobs to meet quarterly earnings targets while this initially doubled earnings and reduced expenses it alienated many of the store managers and rank and file store associates and by extension the customers nardelli who regarded home improvement store by store sales as less important due to market saturation from competition such

star citing engineers criticized home depot s practice of using tilt up construction in hundreds of its big box stores other nearby big box stores in joplin including a walmart and academy sports which had a different concrete masonry unit concrete block construction lost their roofs but the walls remained intact in tilt up construction the concrete is poured on site and lifted into place and then attached to the roof the engineers told the star that the practice while normally safe and efficient is dangerous in major storms because once the roof is lifted as happened in joplin the walls collapse in a domino effect seven people were killed in the front of the store when the 100 000 pound walls collapsed on them while 28 people in the back of the store survived when those walls collapsed outward only two of the slab walls in the home depot survived in contrast 3 people died in the walmart but 200 survived engineers noted that when concrete blocks construction fail it breaks

bank of america dates back to 1904 when amadeo giannini founded the bank of italy usa bank of italy in san francisco the bank of italy served the needs of many immigrants settling in the united states at that time a service denied them by the existing american banks who were very discriminatory and denied service to all but the wealthiest the italian bank of italy was created in 1893 through the merger of 3 of the 6 banks at the time banca nazionale nel regno d italia and 2 tuscan banks giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather lorenzo scatena as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee when the 1906 san francisco earthquake struck giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires because san francisco s banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster from a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels he lent money to those who wished to rebuild later in life he took great pride in the fact that all of these loans were repaid in 1922 giannini established banca d america e d italia bank of america and italy 1986 deutsche bank ag acquires banca d america e d italia from bank of america corp in italy by buying banca dell italia meridionale in 1986 deutsche bank ag acquired 100 of banca d america e d italia a bank established in naples in 1917 following the name change of banca dell italia meridionale the latter established in 1918 in 1918 another corporation bancitaly corporation was organized by a p giannini the largest stockholder of which was stockholders auxiliary corporation this company acquired the stocks of various banks located in new york city and certain foreign countries on march 7 1927 giannini consolidated his bank of italy 101 branches with the newly formed liberty bank of america 175 branches the result was the bank of italy national trust savings association with capital of 30 nbsp million in 1928 a p giannini merged with bank of america los angeles and consolidated it with his other bank holdings to create what would become the largest banking institution in the country he renamed the bank of italy on november 3 1930 calling it bank of america the resulting company was headed by giannini with orra e monnette serving as co chair growth in california giannini sought to build a national bank expanding into most of the western states as well as into the insurance industry under the aegis of his holding company transamerica corporation in 1953 regulators succeeded in forcing the separation of transamerica corporation and bank of america under the clayton antitrust act the passage of the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited banks from owning non bank subsidiary non banking subsidiaries such as insurance companies bank of america and transamerica were separated with the latter company continuing in the insurance business however federal banking regulators prohibited bank of america s interstate banking activity and bank of america s domestic banks outside california were forced into a separate company that eventually became first interstate bancorp later acquired by wells fargo and company in 1996 it was not until the 1980s with a change in federal banking legislation and regulation that bank of america was again able to expand its domestic consumer banking activity outside california new technologies also allowed credit cards to be linked directly to individual bank accounts in 1958 the bank introduced the bankamericard which changed its name to visa credit card visa in 1975 a consortium of other california banks introduced master charge now mastercard to compete with bankamericard expansion outside california following the passage of the bank holding company act of 1956 bankamerica corporation was established for the purpose of owning and operation of bank of america and its subsidiaries bank of america expanded outside california in 1983 with its acquisition of seafirst corporation of seattle washington u s state washington and its wholly owned banking subsidiary seattle first national bank seafirst was at risk of seizure by the federal government after becoming insolvent due to a series of bad loans to the petroleum oil industry bankamerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as seafirst rather than bank of america until the 1998 merger with nationsbank bankamerica experienced huge losses in 1986 and 1987 by the placement of a series of bad loans in the third world particularly in latin america the company fired its ceo sam armacost though armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor alden w clausen a w tom clausen clausen was appointed to replace armacost the losses resulted in a huge decline of bankamerica stock making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover first interstate bancorp of los angeles which had originated from banks once owned by bankamerica launched such a bid in the fall of 1986 although bankamerica rebuffed it mostly by selling operations it sold its financeamerica subsidiary to chrysler and the brokerage firm charles schwab corporation charles schwab and co back to charles r schwab mr schwab it also sold bank of america and italy to deutsche bank by the time of the black monday 1987 1987

which security pacific had acquired in a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s this was at the time the largest bank acquisition in history federal regulators however forced the sale of roughly half of security pacific s washington subsidiary the former rainier bank as the combination of seafirst and security pacific washington would have given bankamerica too large a share of the market in that state the washington branches were divided and sold to west one bancorp now u s bancorp and keybank later that year bankamerica expanded into nevada by acquiring valley bank of nevada in 1994 bankamerica acquired the continental illinois national bank and trust co of chicago which had become federally owned as part of the same oil industry debacle emanating from oklahoma city s penn square bank that had brought down numerous financial institutions including seafirst at the time no bank possessed the resources to bail out continental so the federal government operated the bank for nearly a decade illinois at that time regulated branch banking extremely heavily so bank of america illinois was a single unit bank until the 21st century bankamerica moved its national lending department to chicago in an effort to establish a financial beachhead in the region these mergers helped bankamerica corporation to once again become the largest u s bank holding company in terms of deposits but the company fell to second place in 1997 behind fast growing nationsbank corporation and to third in 1998 behind north carolina s first union corp on the capital markets side the acquisition of continental illinois helped bankamerica to build a leveraged finance origination and distribution business continental illinois had extensive leveraged lending relationships which allowed the firm s

august 3 2009 bank of america agreed to pay a 33 nbsp million fine without admission or denial of charges to the u s securities and exchange commission sec over the non disclosure of an agreement to pay up to 5 8 nbsp billion of bonuses at merrill the bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the merrill acquisition in december 2008 the issue was originally investigated by new york state attorney general andrew cuomo who commented after the suit and announced settlement that the timing of the bonuses as well as the disclosures relating to them constituted a surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility and our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to new york s martin act will continue congressman kucinich commented at the same time that this may not be the last fine that bank of america pays for how it handled its merger of merrill lynch a federal judge jed rakoff in an unusual action refused to approve the settlement on august 5 a first hearing before the judge on august 10 was at times heated and he was sharply critical of the bonuses david rosenfeld represented the sec and lewis j liman son of arthur l liman represented the bank the actual amount of bonuses paid was 3 6 nbsp billion of which 850 nbsp million was guaranteed and the rest was shared amongst 39 000 workers who received average payments of 91 000 696 people received more than 1 nbsp million in bonuses at least one person received a more than 33 nbsp million bonus on september 14 the judge rejected the settlement and told the parties to prepare for trial to begin no later than february 1 2010 the judge focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the bank s shareholders who were the ones that were supposed to have been injured by the lack of disclosure he wrote it is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims money should be used to make the case against the management go away the proposed settlement the judge continued suggests a rather cynical relationship between the parties the s e c gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the bank of america in a high profile merger the bank s management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators and all this is done at the expense not only of the shareholders but also of the truth investigations also were held on this issue in the united states house committee on oversight and government reform under chairman edolphus towns d ny and in its investigative united states house oversight and government reform subcommittee on domestic policy domestic policy subcommittee under kucinich fraud in 2010 the bank was accused by the u s government of defrauding schools hospitals and dozens of state and local government

that as workers worked in teams and became a cohesive unity they increased their perception of their colleagues and often became friends on a similar note bank of america has its employees volunteer for a variety of community service programs which also helps provide a sense of community within the work force and brings employees closer together through volunteering in local areas bank of america employees demonstrate a strong force within the community in which they live this form of volunteering makes the company act like a community within itself which can increase employee morale and the feeling of being a part of a team and demonstrates that the company is engaging in high commitment work practices the group activities provide a feeling of belonging which is associated with human relations where the social organizational structure of the company plays a large role in determining employees feeling of a collective unit however most importantly it recognizes its employees by praising efforts such that individuals or teams receive personalized e cards to show that they are acknowledged for embracing the company s core values the company also rewards its employees by providing employees with recognition awards which can be exchanged for merchandise or gift cards or employees can receive appreciation points which can accumulate for future redemption these incentives are only for entry level to mid level employees these career incentives provide evidence for bureaucratic control within the company all employees receive life management benefits such as tuition reimbursement child care benefits and an employee assistance program which provides confidential services for families and health care including medical dental and vision benefits bank of america bases itself on a pay for performance culture and therefore they have a rewards program in place to reward employees for contributing to the success of the company at the senior level compensation is heavily oriented towards long term incentive plans which vest over a multi year period encouraging managers to both stay at the company as well as focus on long term as opposed to short term profitability at the lower level the long term incentives are a smaller percentage of overall compensation but the company still provides long term incentives for all employees for example the 401 k plans are heavily geared toward increasing payment based on the number of years of service bank of america provides resources for current employees such as the ability to search for other jobs available within bank of america coaching and global learning programs bank of america has an employee learning curriculum where employees can take thousands of different courses with tuition reimbursement this allows employees to further their skills in current positions and also provides the opportunity to advance into other jobs this further provides evidence of bureaucratic control within the company as employees have the ability to move up in the job hierarchy the face of the ceo is present throughout bank of america including the website offices and the annual report to shareholders not only is his physical presence seen throughout the company but he also writes letters to clients shareholders and on manuals such as the code of ethics which can motivate people to trust him to manage the company well and to work hard for him he is also seen throughout the world of finance as a nice boss and one that is trying to prove to the world that he is capable of fixing the problems that arose in the past five years bank of america also expresses its commitment to ensuring that its suppliers use responsible practices and goes as far as surveying suppliers to assess their performance and practices bank of america also commits itself to using local economies in order to be environmental and help boost local businesses due to the team focus diversity and job autonomy there seems to be a lot of high commitment work practices within the bank of america workforce although there is a hierarchy there does appear to be the ability to move up in the workforce and the ceo works as a team with officers below him incentives are also used to ensure people are contributing to the success of the company and want to stay with bank of america for many years these practices encourage creativity and commitment from the employees to the company and are a product of bureaucratic control corporate affairs board of directors as of 2011 03 16 pending addition at

history file general dynmamics 1960 jpg thumb poster by erik nitsche from 1960 electric boat general dynamics traces its ancestry to john philip holland s holland torpedo boat company this company was responsible for developing the u s navy s first submarines built at lewis nixon naval architect lewis nixon s crescent shipyard located in elizabethport new jersey the revolutionary submarine boat holland vi was built there its keel being laid down in 1896 crescent s superintendent and naval architect arthur leopold busch supervised the construction of this submarine after being launched on 17 may 1897 it was eventually purchased by the navy and renamed uss holland the holland was officially commissioned on 12 october 1900 and became the united states navy s first submarine later known as ss 1 the navy placed an order for more submarines which were developed in rapid succession and were assembled at two different locations on both coasts these submarines were known as the a class or adder class and became america s first fleet of underwater craft at the beginning of the 20th century due to the lengthy and expensive process of introducing the world s first practical submarines holland short on funds had to part with his company and sell his interest to financier isaac leopold rice renaming the new firm as the electric boat electric boat company on 7 february 1899 holland effectively lost control of the company and found himself earning a salary of 90 a week as chief engineer while the company he founded was selling submarines for 300 000 each holland resigned from the company effective april 1904 rice became electric boat s first president remaining there from that time until 1915 when he stepped down just prior to his death on 2 november 1915 electric boat gained a reputation for unscrupulous arms dealing in 1904 05 when it sold submarines to japan s imperial japanese navy and russia s imperial russian navy who were then at war holland submarines were also sold to the british royal navy through the english armaments company vickers and to the dutch to serve in the royal netherlands navy the new pioneering craft originally developed by the company was now legitimized as genuine naval weapons by the world s most powerful navies in the post world war ii wind down electric boat was cash flush but lacking in work with its workforce shrinking from 13 000 to 4 000 by 1946 hoping to diversify the president and chief executive officer john jay hopkins started looking for companies that would fit into electric boat s market canadair purchase hopkins quickly found that canadair owned by the canadian government was suffering from similar post war malaise and was up for sale hopkins bought the company for 10 million in 1946 even by the canadian government s calculations the factory alone was worth more than 22 million excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts when electric boat purchased canadair its production line and inventory systems were in disorder hopkins hired canadian born mass production specialist h oliver west to take over the president s role and return canadair to profitability shortly after the takeover canadair began delivering its new canadair north star a version of the douglas dc 4 and was able to deliver aircraft to trans canada airlines canadian pacific airlines and british overseas airways corporation boac well in advance of their contracted delivery times as defense spending increased with the onset of the cold war canadair would go on to win many canadian military contracts for the royal canadian air force and became a major aerospace company these included canadair t 33 trainer the canadair argus long range maritime reconnaissance and military transport aircraft transport aircraft and the canadair f 86 sabre between 1950 and 1958 1 815 sabres were built canadair also produced 200 cf 104 starfighter supersonic fighter aircraft a licensed built version of the lockheed f 104 starfighter lockheed f 104 in 1976 canadair was sold back to the canadian government which sold it to bombardier inc in 1986 general dynamics emerges as the aircraft production at canadair became increasingly important to the company hopkins argued that the name electric boat was no longer appropriate on 24 april 1952 electric boat was reorganized as general dynamics general

quantum dots and nanowires company logo and nickname file original ibm logo png thumb right 150px the company used the globe logo until 1947 when it began using an acronym based logo ibm s current 8 bar logo was designed in 1972 by graphic designer paul rand it was a general replacement for a 13 bar logo that first appeared in public on the 1966 release of the tss 360 logos designed in the 1970s tended to be sensitive to the technical limitations of photocopiers which were then being widely deployed a logo with large solid areas tended to be poorly copied by copiers in the 1970s so companies preferred logos that avoided large solid areas the 1972 ibm logos are an example of this tendency with the advent of digital copiers in the mid 1980s this technical restriction had largely disappeared at roughly the same time the 13 bar logo was abandoned for almost the opposite reasonit was difficult to render accurately on the low resolution digital printers 240 dots per inch of the time the company wrote the ibm atoms ibm initials using individual atoms in 1990 as a demonstration of using a scanning tunneling microscope to move atoms this was the first structure assembled one atom at a time big blue is a nickname for ibm there are several theories explaining the origin of the name one theory substantiated by people who worked for ibm at the time is that ibm field representatives coined the term in the 1960s referring to the color of the mainframes ibm installed in the 1960s and early 1970s true blue referred to a loyal ibm customer and business writers later picked up the term another theory suggests that big blue refers to the company s logo a third theory suggests that big blue refers to a former company dress code that required many ibm employees to wear only white shirts and many wore blue suits in any event ibm keyboards typewriters and some other manufactured devices have played on the big blue concept using the color for enter keys and carriage returns ibm has also used blue logos since 1947 making blue the defining color of the company s corporate design which might be another more plausible reason for the term see also institute of electrical and

routes for its electric power transmission lines on february 13 2007 the washington post reported that the power company was planning to change the route of one 500 kilovolt kv transmission line to appease critics in northern virginia from a route that would cut through protected forest and farmland to a southern route that would bypass nature preserves and american civil war civil war sites by running adjacent to existing power lines however united states house of representatives u s congressional representative frank wolf politician frank wolf republican party united states r virginia va and governor tim kaine democratic party united states d remained opposed to the line saying that there was no real need and that dominion was trying to bring cheap electricity from the midwest dominion contested saying that the line would bring needed electricity to growing northern virginia the proposal was accepted by the state corporation commission scc on october 7 2008 on february 15 2008 the scc approved a controversial proposal for a 230 kv dominion virginia transmission line that would travel above ground for along a woodland wooded portion of the washington old dominion

on march 4 and march 5 2008 the senate of virginia senate and the virginia house of delegates house of delegates of the virginia general assembly unanimity unanimously passed emergency legislation

along with coal and a small amount of waste coal known as spoil tip gob high levels of mercury element mercury emitted from the plant which is controlled by activated carbon injection to reduce the emissions as well as a fly ash dump near the clinch river a source of drinking water are also of concern the plant would also continue to support mountaintop removal coal mining supporters including

import facility in 2001 when dominion s dominion cove point lng lp subsidiary was scheduled to reopen many local residents were concerned about the proximity only 3 miles to the calvert cliffs nuclear power plant and the damage that could be caused by an attack or an explosion at the plant residents thought that the federal energy regulatory commission did not consider the risks before opening the plant in 2005 washington gas claimed that the natural gas imported at the plant was too hot meaning that it contained fewer heavy hydrocarbons and burned hotter washington gas said that the hot gas

through a complex petroleum pricing scheme involving a project in indonesia chevron and texaco before they merged in 2001 each owned 50 percent of a joint venture called caltex which pulled crude oil

chevron document set the price it paid pertamina for oil at 4 55 a barrel higher than the prevailing market price chevron was then able to overstate deductions for costs on its u s income tax returns indonesia appeared to levy tax on this oil at 56 a rate far higher than the corporate tax rate in the u s because the united states gives companies a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments tax

began operating in the oriente region of ecuador in 1964 as a consortium texaco operated the lago agrio oil field from 1972 to 1993 and the ecuador state oil company continued to operate the same oil fields after texaco left in 1993 texaco was found responsible for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste and they spent 40m cleaning up the area during the 1990s in 1998 the ecuadorean government signed an agreement with texaco accepting the clean up as complete and absolving texaco of any further responsibility in 1998 an ecuadorean scientific team took water and soil samples after texaco left and found petroleum hydrocarbons at unsafe levels in almost half the clean up was called a sham by critics chevron claimed that the 1998 agreements with the ecuadorian government exempted the company from any liabilities in 2011 ecuadorian residents were awarded 8 6 billion based on claims of loss of crops and farm animals as well as increased local cancer rates the plaintiffs said this would not be enough to make up for the damage caused by the oil company the award was later revised to 19 billion on appeals which was then appealed again to the ecuadorean national court of justice the action is considered the first time that indigenous people have successfully sued a multinational corporation in the country where the pollution took place in february 2013 a three person tribunal acting under the hague s permanent court of arbitration said the ecuador government should have stopped plaintiffs in the case from going to courts in brazil argentina and canada to try to collect the judgment handed down by an ecuadorean court in 2011 a spokesperson for the plaintiffs said the courts hearing enforcement actions would likely pay little attention to the tribunal since it was not binding on the rain forest communities in may 2013 justice david brown of the ontario superior court stayed the action but ruled that the canadian courts have no jurisdiction to enforce the award ruled by an ecuadorian court in june 2013 argentina s supreme court revoked an embargo on the assets and future income of chevron s argentina subsidiary in september 2013 the hague arbitration panel ruled in favor of chevron finding that an agreement signed in 1995 by the government of ecuador released texaco corporation from financial responsibility from any claims of collective damage however the panel left open the possibility that chevron could still be liable for damages incurred by individuals pollution in richmond california chevron s activities at its century old chevron richmond refinery richmond refinery have been the subject of ongoing controversy the project generated over 11 million pound mass pounds of toxic materials and caused more than 304 accidents the richmond

at refineries nimh battery technology for automobiles chevron was accused to be limiting access to large nimh batteries through its stake in cobasys corporation and control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline this culminated in a lawsuit against panasonic and toyota over production of the ev 95 battery used in the rav4 ev chevron s influence over cobasys extends beyond a strict 50 50 joint venture as it held a 19 99 interest in ecd ovonics in her book plug in hybrids the cars that will recharge america published in february 2007 sherry boschert argues that large format nimh batteries are commercially viable but that cobasys refuses to sell the batteries or license the technology to small companies or individuals boschert argues that cobasys accepts only very large orders for the batteries major automakers showed little interest in placing large orders for large format nimh batteries however toyota complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format nimh batteries to service the existing 825 rav 4evs because no other companies were willing to place large orders cobasys was not manufacturing or licensing large format nimh battery technology for automobiles boschert concludes that it s possible that cobasys chevron is squelching all access to large nimh batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline or it s possible that cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug in hybrids or electric vehicles in an interview with the economist the ecd ovonics founder stan ovshinsky subscribed to the former view i think we at ecd we made a mistake of having a joint venture with an oil company frankly speaking and i think it s not a good idea to go into business with somebody whose strategies would put you out of business rather than building the business in addition chevron maintained the right to seize all of cobasys intellectual property rights if ecd ovonics does not fulfill its contractual obligations on september 10 2007 chevron filed a legal claim that ecd ovonics has not fulfilled its obligations ecd ovonics disputes this claim in october 2007 international acquisitions services and innovative transportation systems filed suit against cobasys and its parents for refusing to fill an order for large format

contest to six charges in connection with the fire and agreed to pay 2 million in fines and restitution around the same time the settlement was announced the richmond city council voted to file suit

ks endeavor explosion the ks endeavor jackup rig exploded on january 16 2012 while drilling an exploration well for chevron in the funiwa field in nigeria the explosion resulted in the death of two of the 154 workers on board and a fire that burned for 46 days before the well was sealed on june 18 according to a reuters news report workers on the ks endeavor were ignored by chevron when they requested evacuation due to concerns of increasing smoke billowing from the drilling borehole a senior worker said the blowout was triggered by a massive build up of pressure a witness said that rig engineers advised chevron to stop drilling and evacuate staff but chevron told them to continue with drilling expecting an explosion the rig manager one of the two that later died kept the lifeboats at hand and ready for use a witness reported this is the reason so many of us survived because we were all aware that it was going to happen but just didn t know when in an email response to reuters chevron said it did not receive requests to evacuate the rig and that staff on board had the right to call a halt to work if they believed conditions were unsafe destruction of natural forest in bangladesh on june 26 2008 a fire in lawachara national park a natural forest a major national park rare of its kind in the region and crucial to maintain the biodiversity of bangladesh s flora wildlife of bangladesh fauna had broken out as chevron corp carried out a 3d seismic survey that was to be six months long the company had violated the conditions of the government s environment clearance certificate by not informing the ministry about the cracks that had occurred in nearby residents properties due to explosions caused by their activities polish gas exploration chevron has experienced mass protests aimed at the company by local communities in southern poland when they started gas exploration in the region their complaint is that chevron didn t provide all of the documents required for gas exploration in poland and that the company has not promised to share a percentage of the revenues with the local landholders the landholders of the region view chevron s presence in the region negatively since they may be forced to sell their properties at a low cost if gas is discovered in the region as well potential environmental disasters are a concern for local farmers another of the residents primary concern is water pollution from the chemicals used in fracking in response to some of the protests chevron has sued some of the protesters from urawl w for disrupting their operations according to gas and oil expert andrzej szczesniak one of the main reasons for the protest is the difference between polish and american law in the usa property owners typically receive 15 20 from the income of gas exploration though in poland the discovery of gas on private property usually results in a forced sale of the property with the owner receiving only the prior value of the land and no percentage of the gas revenue this is the result of outdated communist era laws that are still on the books and which are often exploited by municipal governments if the

2012 folding its mobile focused ea interactive eai division into other organizations throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale 1982 1991 in february 1982 trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc in which hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capital s spare office space to start the company on may 28 1982 trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated seven months later in december 1982 hawkins secured of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield byers and sevin rosen funds file electronic arts historical logo svg thumb left 300px electronic arts original corporate logo 1982 2000 for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capital s office in august 1982 during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as game producer producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october 8 1982 between september and november employee headcount rose to 11 including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo california san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco international airport san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in 1983 including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late 1984 and helped the company sustain growth into in its third full year this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december 1986 david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro california pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october 1982 hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a best selling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleep hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordon s suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film tron when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying we re not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of ea s trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with ea s packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling in the mid 1980s electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga mistakenly believing that its low price and sophistication would cause the computer to supplant the apple macintosh pc compatibles instead became the dominant personal computer in 1990 electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other console game publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now

several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the national football league nfl and in january 2005 a 15 year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april 11 2005 ea announced a similar 6 year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of ea s success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platform agnostic development and the creation of strong multi year franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in 2006 that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property in september 2006 nokia and

sara lee corporation sara lee and pepsico in june 2007 new ceo john riccitiello announced that ea would reorganize itself into four labels each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing the city state model the goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decision making increase creativity and quality and get games into the market faster this reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by ea of smaller studios which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of ea titles in 2008 at the dice summit riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent riccitiello said that the city state model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent and cited maxis and bioware as examples of studios thriving under the new structure also in 2007 ea announced that it would be bringing some of its major titles to the macintosh ea has released battlefield 2142 command conquer tiberium wars crysis harry potter and the order of the phoenix madden nfl 08 need for speed carbon and spore 2008 video

electronic arts is closing their casual label merging it with their hasbro partnership with the sims label ea also confirmed the departure of kathy vrabeck who was given the position as former president of the ea casual division in may 2007 ea made this statement about the merger we ve learned a lot about casual entertainment in the past two years and found that casual gaming defies a single genre and demographic with the retirement and departure of kathy vrabeck ea is reorganizing to integrate casual games development and marketing into other divisions of our business we are merging our casual studios hasbro partnership and casual marketing organization with the sims label to be a new sims and casual label where there is a deep compatibility in the product design marketing and demographics in the days and weeks ahead we will make further announcements on the reporting structure for the other businesses in the casual label including ea mobile pogo media sales and online casual initiatives those businesses remain growth priorities for ea and deserve strong support in a group that will compliment their objectives this statement comes a week after ea

holiday season moving it in february 2009 to cut approximately 1100 jobs which it said represented about 11 of its workforce it will also close 12 facilities yet to be identified riccitiello in a

grasshopper manufacture shank video game shank klei entertainment syndicate 2012 video game syndicate starbreeze studios titanfall respawn entertainment warp 2012 video game warp trapdoor company trapdoor criticism studio acquisition and management practices during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example origin systems origin produced ultima viii ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under ea s ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early 2008 ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture and decided to go with ea partners despite having a poor opinion of the publisher s past record blockquote i ll admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studios i d have been surprised if you told me a year ago that we d end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve corporation valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them blockquote like other ea partners such as harmonix mtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isn t really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and we re probably taking a third set though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet 2 was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of 19 9 percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisoft s then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july 2010 ea elected to sell its reduced 15 percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly treatment of employees in 2004 electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours up to 100 hours per week and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are 9 nbsp a m to 10 nbsp p m seven days a week with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at 6 30 pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded as a result many of the lower level developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by game programmer programmers was settled for since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address work life balance concerns by focusing on long term project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february 2007 in december 2007 an internal ea employee survey showed a 13 increase in employee morale and a 21 increase in perception of management recognition over a three year period in may 2008 ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and i ve been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact i ve actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game quality for 2006 the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as 72 0 out of 100 2 5 points behind nintendo 74 5 but ahead of the other first party publishers microsoft studios game studio microsoft 71 6 and sony computer entertainment sony 71 2 the closest third party publisher is take two interactive publishing as 2k games and rockstar games at 70 3 the remaining top 10 publishers sega thq ubisoft activision square enix all rate in the mid 60s since 2005 ea has published eight games that received universal acclaim metacritic score 90 or greater battlefield 2 crysis rock band video game rock band fifa 12 fifa 13 mass effect 2 mass effect 3 and dragon age origins ea s aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankings com aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as 2007 which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation vis vis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that ea s innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snail s pace while even the company s own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying we re boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinse and repeat there s been lots of product that looked like last year s product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in 2012 ea s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic in june 2013 ea attracted criticism from users for replacing its scrabble app on facebook with a new version that did not retain players histories and statistics the new version added functionality including support for other languages and board customization anti trust lawsuit on june 5 2008 a lawsuit was filed in oakland california oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states anti trust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasn t on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee more recently ea has been sued by former ncaa players for allegedly using their images without compensation eula and drm in the september 2008 release of ea s game spore 2008 video game spore it was revealed that the digital rights management drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machine activation limit of three 3 instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazon com with one star ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of pirates to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was pirated well before release on september 13 2008 it was announced that spore was the most pirated game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command conquer red alert 3 would increase the installation limit to 5 rather than 3 on september 22 2008 a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october 14 2008 a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march 31 2009 ea released a de authorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to de authorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june 24 2009 ea announced and formalized a change in its approach to preventing piracy of pc games the company plans to drop all drm from its games replacing it with a traditional cd key check however games will include content that is not present on the disc requiring a download during the activation of the game the intent is to create an incentive to buy a legitimate copy of the game a general policy has been laid out with plans envisioning games more as services with a lot of content to freely download or buy linked to the game some goodies and regular updates as a way to coax players to use the genuine copies of ea games in 2013 ea received criticism regarding its always on drm persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity 2013 video game simcity reboot advertising ea s advertising campaign for dead space 2 was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing out dated stereotypes against female and older gamers the game is rated m for mature and is therefore only recommended for players over the age of seventeen others thought the advertisements were pointless and would hurt market share the video game s campaign hinges on a unique premise one that ignores how much the culture of gaming has changed as of 2010 40 of console only gamers were women and the average game player was 34 years old for the advertising campaign 200 women were selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in ea s web and tv advertisements with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space 2 on february 24 2011 the extra credits team at the time on the escapist magazine the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dante s inferno video game dante s inferno medal of honor series medal of honor and dead space 2 releases they argue that ea s decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a 1st amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the 1980s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry the consumerist worst company in america in april 2012 the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the record breaking poll drew in more than 250 000 votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as at t and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with 50 575 votes or 64 03 this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect 3 controversy mass effect 3 ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to ea s win in the poll other explanations include use of day one downloadable content dlc and ea s studio acquisition and management practices habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying we re sure that british petroleum aig philip morris usa philip morris and halliburton are all relieved they weren t nominated this year we re going to continue making award winning games and services played by more than 300 million people worldwide in april 2013 ea won the consumerist s poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect 3 for its ending dead space 3 for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity 2013 video game simcity reboot due to its simcity 2013 video game release poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea s business practices that so many people have for the second year in a row come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims 4 a single player offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said the settlement is reported to be around 40 million dollars to be paid to between 200 000 and 300 000 players battlefield 4 downloadable content bugs lawsuit on december 19 2013 ea was hit with class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield 4 dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation 4 and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the online forum forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice

minneapolis minnesota minneapolis by earl bakken and his brother in law palmer hermundslie as a medical equipment repair shop they originally wanted to sell basketball pumps due to a shortage in the midwest in the 20th century bakken began as a graduate student in electrical engineering at the university of minnesota before he gave up his studies to focus on medtronic through their repair business bakken came to know c walton lillehei a pioneer in the field of cardiac surgery heart surgery then at the university of minnesota medical school lillehei was frustrated with the artificial pacemaker pacemakers of the day which were quite large applied electrical current externally requiring higher voltages and had to be plugged into a mains electricity wall outlet to operate the deficiencies of such pacemakers were made painfully obvious following a power outage over halloween in 1957 which affected large sections of minnesota and western wisconsin as a direct result of this blackout a pediatrics pediatric patient of dr lillehei who was pacemaker dependent died the next day lillehei spoke with bakken about developing some form of battery powered pacemaker stemming from this need bakken modified a design for a transistorized metronome to create the first battery powered external artificial pacemaker file 2012 0907 oldmedtronichq jpg thumb right medtronic s old

debilitating effects of coronary aortic and structural heart disease in 2007 medtronic recalled its sprint fidelis product consisting of the flexible wires or leads which connect a defibrillator to

purchased a significant portion of priceline s stock history priceline first became known for its name your own price system where travelers would name their price for airline tickets hotel rooms car rentals and vacation packages while the purchaser can select a general location service level and price the hotel rental car company and or airline as well as the exact location of the hotel and the exact flight itinerary is disclosed only after the purchase had gone through with no rights to cancel in some cases the flights are worse than the published flights on their website and multiple customers have warned and proclaimed priceline as a scam priceline s cut of the proceeds was the difference between the price an individual named and the price charged by the service establishment more recently it has added a more traditional model where travelers are presented prices and are also told the name of the establishment travelers can still choose to name their price for airline

college roommates laurence k marshall and vannevar bush along with scientist charles g smith founded the american appliance company in cambridge massachusetts its focus which was originally on new refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics the company s first product was a gaseous helium rectifier that was based on charles smith s earlier astronomy astronomical research of the star zeta puppis the electron tube was christened with the name raytheon light of from the gods and was used in a battery eliminator a type of receiver radio radio receiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large battery electricity batteries this made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive short lived batteries in 1925 the company changed its name to raytheon manufacturing company and began marketing its rectifier under the raytheon brand name with great commercial success in 1928 raytheon merged with q r s company an american manufacturer of electron tubes and switches to form the successor of the same name raytheon manufacturing company in 1933 it diversified by acquiring acme delta company a producer of transformers power equipment and electronic auto parts by the 1930s it had already grown to become one of the world s largest vacuum tube manufacturing companies during world war ii early in world war ii physicists in the united kingdom invented the magnetron a specialized microwave generating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft american companies were then sought by the us government to perfect and mass produce the magnetron for ground based airborne and shipborne radar systems and with support from the massachusetts institute of technology s radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months of being awarded the contract raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems at war s end in 1945 the company was responsible for about 80 percent of all magnetrons manufactured during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon ranked 71st among united states corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts raytheon s research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food in 1945 raytheon s percy spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food in 1947 the company demonstrated the radarange microwave oven for commercial use after world war ii in 1945 the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the submarine signal company founded in 1901 a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment with its broadened capabilities

vast majority of raytheon s revenues have been obtained from defense contracts there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the u s department of defense and other u s government departments and agencies e g in the fiscal year 2007 the national science foundation awarded raytheon 152 million in grants more than to any other institution and organization in the country for managing nsf south pole station this along with heavy lobbying has led to perennial charges of influence peddling raytheon for instance contributed nearly a million dollars to various defense related political campaigns in the presidential election year of 2004 spending much more than that on lobbying expenses and there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government for example richard armitage politician richard armitage a former united states deputy secretary of state is linked to the company through consultancy work john m deutch a former u s director of central intelligence sits on the board of directors along with warren rudman a former senator on the other hand raytheon has also been involved in several contract disputes with the u s government u s district judge albert v bryan jr imposed a us dollar 10 000 criminal fine for one felony count of conveyance without authority and 900 000 in civil penalties and damages the documents allegedly gave raytheon an unfair advantage against its competitors in bidding for weapons contracts although the plea only involved 1983 air force documents united states attorney henry hudson said raytheon also illegally obtained a wide range of secret the pentagon pentagon documents disputed claims of the patriot missile during the 1991 gulf war raytheon received widespread publicity in the united states in connection with its manufacture of the patriot missile mim 104 patriot the patriot missile is an anti aircraft missile that was upgraded to have some capability against ballistic missiles the patriot had allegedly intercepted scud missiles launched by iraq in its defense against the u s led invasion when president george h w bush traveled to raytheon s patriot manufacturing plant in andover massachusetts during the gulf war he declared the patriot is 41 for 42 42 scuds engaged 41 intercepted after the gulf war had concluded the staff of the house government operations subcommittee on legislation and national security reported the patriot missile system was not the spectacular success in the persian gulf war that the american public was led to believe there is little evidence to prove that the patriot hit more than a few scud missiles launched by iraq during the gulf war and there are some doubts about even these engagements the public and the united states congress were misled by definitive statements of success issued by administration and raytheon representatives during and after the war contract disputes in october 1994 raytheon paid 4 million to settle a u s government claim that it inflated a defense contract for antimissile radar the pave paws precision acquisition vehicle entry phased array warning system system was designed to detect incoming submarine launched ballistic missiles the government claimed in a federal lawsuit that raytheon inflated a contract to upgrade two of four pave paws sites by proposing to hire higher skilled employees than were necessary for the job the boston herald reported that ages alleged that the security firm wackenhut wackenhut corporation hired by raytheon used video and audio surveillance to espionage spy on a consulting firm hired by ages to help it prepare its bid ages also alleged that stolen confidential pricing documents were turned over to raytheon both raytheon and ages had been vying for the contract which raytheon had held for decades but which ages won in 1996 on may 12 1999 reuters reported that raytheon would pay 3 million to ages group and purchase 13 million worth of ages aircraft parts to settle the ages lawsuit the settlement was exceptional in that the parties agreed that judgment law judgment would be entered against raytheon legally establishing the validity of ages allegations securities litigation in october 1999 raytheon was the subject of a number of securities class action lawsuits alleging it had issued a series of materially false and misleading statements including overstating the company s 1997 and 1998 revenues concealing cost overruns and inflating its financial results the suits were brought in response to a massive drop in value of raytheon s common stock as traded on the new york stock exchange on tuesday october 12 1999 raytheon shares were trading at about 45 below the level at which they had been traded on october 11 1999 the plunge in stock prices was triggered by a wall street journal report that raytheon was over cost or behind schedule on more than a dozen fixed price defense contracts this crash represented a loss of about 8 billion in market value in a single day on may 13 2004 raytheon reported that it had reached a preliminary agreement to pay 410 million in cash and securities to settle a class action lawsuit alleging it misled investors by not disclosing difficulties on various pentagon and construction projects five years before swanson s unwritten rules of management on april 24 2006 in a statement released by raytheon ceo swanson admitted to plagiarism in claiming authorship for his booklet swanson s unwritten rules of management after a report by the new york times on may 2 2006 raytheon withdrew distribution of the book the following day the company s board of directors announced that in response to this matter the board has decided not to raise mr swanson s salary above its

specific eligibility requirements case histories vioxx in 1999 the food and drug administration united states u s food and drug administration fda approved vioxx known generically as rofecoxib a merck product for treating arthritis vioxx was stronger than existing medications while easier on the stomach than established anti inflammatory drugs such as naproxen vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history according to internal e mail traffic released at a later lawsuit merck had a list of doctors critical of vioxx to be neutralised or discredited we may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live wrote an employee also alleged were intimidation of researchers and impingement upon academic freedom thereafter studies by merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with vioxx use when compared with naproxen there was no indication of this risk in the original placebo controlled safety trials and it was possible that the effect was more related to naproxen decreasing the risk of heart attacks than one of vioxx increasing the risk merck adjusted the labeling of vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002 on september 23 2004 merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months on september 28 2004 merck notified the fda that it was voluntarily withdrawing vioxx from the market and it publicly announced the withdrawal on september 30 the fda has since recommended that vioxx be put back on the market but with a more prominent warning regarding cardiovascular risks on its label on november 5 2004 the medical journal the lancet published the results of its analysis of the available studies it concluded that the unacceptable cardiovascular risks of vioxx rofecoxib were evident as early as 2000 the journal s editors criticized merck for having kept the drug on the market as long as it did before withdrawing it and also criticized the fda for its failure of regulatory oversight about 50 000 people have sued merck claiming that they or their family members have suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking vioxx the new york pension fund also sought lead plaintiff status in this case on behalf of all investors that had lost money in 2005 merck was found liable in the first case that went to trial and the plaintiff was awarded 253 4 million in damages however the judgement was subsequently reduced to 20 million and then upon appeal the verdict was reversed in 2008 the settlement will require that claimants provide medical proof of having suffered a heart attack or a stroke and show they received at least 30 vioxx pills this proposed settlement is generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for merck considering that original estimates of merck s liability reached as high as 50 billion as of mid 2008 plaintiffs have prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that have reached juries all with relatively small awards all its new television pain advertisements must be

insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector the black fly however when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease the who agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies merck s involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the mectizan donation program that covers countries such as yemen and in african countries currently more than 700 million people have been treated since the

issues of a medical journal the australasian journal of bone and joint medicine published by elsevier although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer reviewed journal without any indication that merck had paid for it the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to merck the misleading publication came to light

caterpillar suffered further when the united states declared an united states embargoes embargo against the soviet union after the soviet invasion of afghanistan causing the company to be unable to sell us 400 million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to strikes primarily by the members of the united auto workers against caterpillar facilities in illinois and pennsylvania several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations in 1992 the united auto workers conducted a five month strike against caterpillar in response caterpillar threatened to replace caterpillar s entire unionized work force over ten thousand uaw members striked again in 1994 1995 for 17 months a record at that time the strike ended with the uaw deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by caterpillar in 1994 caterpillar offered a contract to the uaw members that would have raised the salary of top workers from 35 000 to 39 000 per year however the uaw was seeking the same top wage of 40 000 that was paid to workers at deere company in 1994 during the strikes caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production caterpillar suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other non bargained for employees into caterpillar s manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way caterpillar achieved its goal was by outsourcing much of caterpillar s parts production and warehouse work to outside firms in another move according to united auto workers union officials and industry analysts

texas and north little rock arkansas in 2012 the company locked out workers at a locomotive plant in london ontario canada and demanded some accept up to a 50 cut in pay the move created controversy

of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers local lodge 851 went on strike an agreement was reached in august resulting in a 6 year wage freeze striking workers expressed

signed a consent decree with the united states department of justice justice department and the california state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during pre sale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smog forming nitrogen oxides nox in 1998 alone these violating vehicles emitted 1 3 million tons of additional nox an amount equal to the emissions of 65 million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august 2000 by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that 83 million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october 2002 caterpillar nbsp the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline nbsp was forced to pay

updated equivalent there are many ti calculators still selling without graphing capabilities the ti 30 has been replaced by the ti 30 ti 30x iis there are some financial calculators for sale on the ti website in 2007 ti released the ti nspire family of calculators as well as computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators texas instruments calculator community in the 1990s with the advent of ti s graphing calculator series programming became popular among some students the ti 8x series of calculators beginning with the ti 81 came with a built in basic interpreter through which simple programs could be created the ti 85 was the first ti calculator to allow assembly language assembly programming via a shell called zshell and the ti 83 was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assembly based programs rival what one might find on a game boy or personal digital assistant pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculator relevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the now defunct ti files and still active ticalc org the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early 2000s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to 100 programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z80 and those running on the motorola 68000 series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed brute force attack brute force to find the keys and publish them in 2009 ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas instruments signing key controversy enthusiasts had already been creating their own operating systems before the finding of the keys which could be installed with other methods industry recognition in 2007 texas instruments

established near le havre france in world war ii as explained in introducton the cigarette camps at the website the cigarette camps the u s army caps in the le havre area blockquote the staging area camps were named after various brands of american cigarettes the assembly area camps were named after american cities the names of cigarettes and cities were chosen for two reasons first and primarily for security referring to the camps without an indication of their geographical location went a long way to ensuring that the enemy would not know precisely where they were anybody eavesdropping or listening to radio traffic would think that cigarettes were being discussed or the camp was stateside especially regarding the city camps secondly there was a subtle psychological reason the premise being that troops heading into battle wouldn t mind staying at a place where cigarettes must be plentiful and troops about to depart for combat would be somehow comforted in places with familiar names of cities back home camp atlanta camp baltimore camp new york and camp pittsburgh among others by war s end however all of the cigarette and city camps were devoted to departees many processed

qualcomm gobi is a mobile broadband chipset used mainly for cellular data networking and it is also now used in a few enterprise smart phones e g motorola es400 it currently is a 3g technology capable up to high speed packet access hspa on gsm and ev do rev a on cdma carriers the gobi chipset is a microprocessor that can load a specific carrier image so that the device appears to be specifically designed for that carrier s network since gsm and cdma are quite different and since gobi devices can switch between them both using the same silicon their solution is considered to be innovative gobi technology is best suited for large enterprise customers where a single mobile operator cannot serve all of their wireless modem needs since there is not one carrier that was provide the same level of service in all the places they need that service the gobi solution allows the it department to roll out a single module on their laptop builds which can be configured to behave exactly like a device that is locked to the carrier that they want to use in that area in the united states exactly the same hardware can be used on the cdma network or the gsm network of their choice for gsm users that travel out of the united states the gobi solution can be used to avoid international roaming charges by switching the sim and the device s carrier image to a local provider instead of incurring the roaming charges in both scenarios the customer must have different wireless accounts with each provider they wish to use natively it typically takes 20 seconds for the device to load the carrier image into nvram and reset and come back online gobi 3000 is the next hardware revision of the gobi platform and it natively supports hspa the model for gobi 3000 is different it is a reference design the oems can licence and produce their own gobi 3000 compliant modules with their own extensions qualcomm does not sell any gobi 3000 silicon the reference design allows the same boilerplate hardware and software components for the basis of oem chips which allow the oems to focus on innovations on the mobile broadband platform rather than getting bogged down with low level rf implementations future gobi platforms will support lte natively currently some gobi 3000 modules support lte through their own extensions mirasol displays mirasol displays are the world s first and only reflective bistable display based on interferometric modulator display imod technology qualcomm s mirasol displays use ambient light as their source of illumination and consume almost no power when the image is unchanged

resonant inductive coupling created from more than 10 years of research at auckland university software operating system brew qualcomm brew binary runtime environment for wireless is a proprietary cell phone application platform brew is designed so that the platform rejects unsigned applications in order to have an application signed a developer must pay a testing fee to http www nstl com national software testing labs nstl which then can approve or deny the request this allows carriers to maintain control over the applications that run on their customers phones bitpim is a popular open source program which can access the embedded filesystem on phones using qualcomm msms via a cable or bluetooth it should be pointed out that signing systems are also used in apple ios java me and

into a deal with mattel mattel had previously made the intellivision in 1979 and had some experience in the video games industry at that time nintendo had in a previous incarnation also been a toy

offering msg as a premium subscription service just like sportschannel yes network cablevision did not carry most of the games of the new york yankees in 2002 because they would not accept the price asked during the inaugural season of yes network again at the root of the argument was who was to pay for sports programming cablevision wanted to offer yes as a premium service like msg and fox sports ny where yes ownership wanted the channel on the family cable tier after a long standoff a deal was made the following year as a result yes along with msg and fox sports ny moved to the family

reorganizing itself into a joint stock company stock company as opposed to a mutual company it soon spread its operations across the country in 1998 it acquired usf g known formerly as united states fidelity and guaranty company an insurance company based in baltimore maryland but was forced to downsize by almost half due to a competitive marketplace travelers was founded in 1864 in hartford it was originally founded to provide travel insurance to rail transport railroad travelers at a time when travel was far more risky and dangerous than today hence the name along the way it had many industry firsts including the first automobile policy the first commercial airline policy and the first policy for space travel by the early 1990s travelers was predominantly a general property and

notably many of travelers ancestor companies such as st paul and usf g are still around today and still write policies and accept claims but only on paper as is typical of most insurance in the united states insurers in the united states travelers never dissolved the various companies it acquired but simply made them wholly owned subsidiaries and trained its employees to act on behalf of those subsidiaries this is a common risk management strategy used by u s insurance groups if any one company in the group gets hit with too many claims the situation can be easily contained to that one
