success corporate identity logo ref according to steve jobs apple was so named because jobs was coming back from an apple farm and he was on a fruitarian diet he thought the name was fun spirited and not intimidating apple s first logo designed by ron wayne depicts sir isaac newton sitting under an apple tree it was almost immediately replaced by rob janoff s rainbow apple the now familiar rainbow colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it janoff presented jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the bitten logo and jobs immediately took a liking to it while jobs liked the logo he insisted it be in color to humanize the company the logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry the colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible and to represent the fact the apple ii could generate graphics in color both janoff and apple deny any homage to turing in the design of the logo on august 27 1999 but apple inc had trademark issues with apple corps apple corps ltd a multimedia company started by the beatles in 1967 involving their name and logo this resulted in a apple corps v apple computer series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies these issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007 advertising apple s first slogan byte into an apple was coined in the late 1970s from 1997 2002 the slogan think different was used in advertising campaigns and is still closely associated with apple apple also has slogans for specific product lines nbsp for example ithink therefore imac was used in 1998 to promote the imac and say hello to iphone has been used in iphone advertisements hello was also used to introduce the original macintosh newton platform newton imac hello again and ipod since the introduction of the macintosh in 1984 with the 1984 television commercial 1984 super bowl commercial to the more modern get a mac adverts apple has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products though its apple inc advertising criticism advertising was criticized for the claims made by some later campaigns particularly the 2005 power mac ads and iphone ads in britain apple s product commercials gained fame for launching musicians into stardom as a result of their eye popping graphics and catchy tunes first the company popularized canadian singer feist singer feist s 1234 song 1234 song in its ad campaign apple s brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product at one time apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established apple evangelist guy kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism something that was stumbled upon apple has however supported the continuing existence of a network of macintosh user group mac user groups in most major and many minor centers of population where mac computers are available mac users would meet at the european apple expo and the san francisco macworld conference expo trade shows where apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until apple pulled out of both events while the conferences continue apple does not have official representation there mac developers in turn continue to gather at the annual apple worldwide developers conference apple store openings can draw crowds of thousands with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event the new york city fifth avenue cube store had a line as long as half a mile a few mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage the ginza opening in tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks john sculley told the guardian newspaper in 1997 people talk about technology but apple was a marketing company it was the marketing company of the decade research in 2002 by nielsen online netratings indicate that the average apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other pc company consumers the research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average apple inc products are more expensive than other pc products corporate affairs during the mac s early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with apple s adoption of the peripheral component interconnect pci bus in the power macintosh 7500 7500 power macintosh 8500 8500 power macintosh 9500 9500 power macintosh power macs apple has since adopted usb agp hypertransport wi fi and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as usb firewire is an apple originated standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as ieee 1394 ever since the first apple store opened apple has sold third party accessories for instance at one point nikon and canon company canon digital cameras were sold inside the store adobe software adobe one of apple s oldest software partners also sells its mac compatible software as does microsoft who sells microsoft office for the mac books from john wiley sons who publishes the for dummies series of instructional books are a notable exception however the publisher s line of books were banned from apple stores in 2005 because steve jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized jobs biography icon after the launch of the ibookstore apple stopped selling physical books both online and at the apple retail stores headquarters apple inc s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of silicon valley at 1 6 infinite loop street infinite loop cupertino california cupertino california this apple campus has six buildings that total and was built in 1993 by sobrato development cos in 2006 apple announced its intention to build a second campus on assembled from various contiguous plots east of n wolfe road between pruneridge avenue and vallco parkway later acquisitions increased this to 175 acres the new campus also in cupertino will be about east of the current campus the new campus building will be designed by norman foster on october 15 2013 it was announced that the cupertino city council has approved the proposed spaceship design campus on june 7 2011 steve jobs gave a presentation to cupertino city council detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs the new campus is planned to house up to 13 000 employees in one central four storied circular building with a caf for 3 000 sitting people integrated surrounded by extensive landscape with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure the new campus will be built on the former hp headquarters next to interstate 280 the morning of the announcement apple ceo tim cook tweeted our home for innovation and creativity for decades to come cupertino city council gives unanimous approval for apple s new campus the 2 8 million square foot facility which will include steve jobs s original designs for a fitness center and corporate auditorium will be able to house 14 000 employees and will have enough parking to accommodate almost all of them apple s headquarters for europe the middle east and africa emea are located in cork city cork in the south of republic of ireland ireland the facility which opened in 1980 was apple s first location outside of the united states apple sales international which deals with all of apple s international sales outside of the usa is located at apple s campus in cork along with apple distribution international which similarly deals with apple s international distribution network on april 20 2012 apple announced the addition of 500 new jobs to its european headquarters this will bring the total workforce from around 2 800 to 3 300 employees the company will build a new office block on its hollyhill campus to accommodate the additional staff corporate culture apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a corporate culture should look like in organizational hierarchy flat versus tall casual versus formal attire etc other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include southwest airlines and microsoft originally the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like ibm by default thanks to the influence of its founders steve jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple was a fortune 500 company by the time of the 1984 television commercial 1984 tv ad this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors according to a 2011 report in fortune magazine fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives each with his own idea of what apple should be some of its original character has arguably been lost but apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ this was especially after jobs s return to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman numerous employees of apple have cited that projects without jobs s involvement often took longer than projects with his involvement at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having best in class employees in every role for instance ron johnson businessman ron johnson who was senior vice president of retail operations until november 1 2011 was responsible for site selection in store service and store layout yet he had no control of the inventory in his stores which is done company wide by then coo and now ceo tim cook who has a background in supply chain management this is the opposite of general electric s corporate culture which has created well rounded managers the company previously advertised its products as being made in america up to the late 1990s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s almost all of its manufacturing is now done abroad according to a report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that made in the u s a is no longer a viable option for most apple products unlike other major us companies apple has a relatively simple compensation policy for executives which does not include perks that other ceos enjoy such as country club fees and private use of company aircraft the company usually grants stock options to executives every other year a media article published in july 2013 provided details about apple s at home apple advisors customer support program that serves as the corporation s call center the advisors are employed within the u s and work remotely after undergoing a four week training program that also serves as a testing period the advisors earn between us 9 and 12 per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support employee relations a class action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation has been filed against apple in a california federal district court litigation apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation and like its competitors and peers engages in litigation trying legal cases before the courts in its normal course of business for a variety of reasons in particular apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests some examples include apple v samsung apple v microsoft motorola mobility v apple inc motorola v apple apple corps v apple computer finance in its fiscal year ending in september 2011 apple inc reported a total of 108 billion in annual revenues a significant

apple apple inc released a statement committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100 clean energy in 2013 apple announced it was using 100 renewable energy to power their data centers and overall 75 of its power comes from renewable sources in 2010 climate counts a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies gave apple a score of 52 points out

electronics companies at which time climate counts also labeled apple with a stuck icon adding that apple at the time was a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer toxics greenpeace has campaigned against apple because of various environmental issues including a global end of life take back plan non recyclable hardware components and toxins within iphone hardware since 2003

subsidiaries in low tax places such as the republic of ireland the netherlands luxembourg and the british virgin islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world according to the new york times in the 1980s apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low tax subsidiaries on other continents sidestepping income taxes in the late 1980s apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the double irish arrangement dutch sandwich double irish with a dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through irish subsidiaries and the netherlands and then to the caribbean british conservative party member of parliament charlie elphicke published research on october 30 2012 which showed that some multinational companies including apple inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the uk but were paying an effective tax rate to the uk treasury of only 3 percent well below standard corporation tax he followed this research by calling on the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne to force these multinationals which also included google and coca cola to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their uk revenues elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of uk tax charitable

developed a competing standard truetype which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font s outlines and licensed it to microsoft adobe responded by publishing the type 1 specification and releasing adobe type manager software that allowed wysiwyg scaling of type 1 fonts on screen like truetype although without the precise pixel level control but these moves were too late to stop the rise of truetype although type 1 remained the standard in the graphics publishing market truetype became the standard for business and the average windows user in 1996 adobe and microsoft announced the opentype font format and in 2003 adobe completed converting its type 1 font library to opentype in the mid 1980s adobe entered the consumer computer software software market with adobe illustrator a vector graphics vector based drawing program for the apple macintosh illustrator which grew from the firm s in house font development software helped

to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs5 adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe s software has been criticized for among other things slow performance and frequent crashes marketing ethics adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software third party browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the adobe flash flash update process and for pushing a third party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs criticism of creative cloud adobe has caused concerns within the photography and filmmaking community especially long term users in may 2013 adobe systems announced plans to end perpetual software licensing for its adobe creative suite creative suite products in favor of a subscription based service model called creative cloud which had been introduced as an alternative licensing model in may 2012 shifting to a software as a service model adobe announced more frequent feature updates to its products and the eschewing of their traditional release cycles customers must pay a monthly subscription fee and if they stop paying they will lose access to the software as well as to the work they saved in proprietary format proprietary file format which is not backward compatible with the creative suite adobe admitted that this is a valid concern in addition they will not be able to retrieve their files from the cloud once the subscription has expired they must have internet connection to download the software and to use the 2 gb of provided storage space or the additionally purchased 20 gb and must validate the license monthly although investors applauded the move the reaction across segments of adobe s user base was swift this shift has been met with mixed reviews by both corporations and independent designers with many people expressing their displeasure on the web and through multiple internet petitions calling upon adobe to continue selling creative software under the perpetual licensing model among these was a change org petition which reached over 30 000 signatures within a few weeks of the announcement currently as of january 21 2014 at 46 300 according to the critics the move to a perpetual rental scheme was highly disruptive to many users and caused an unprecedented loss of trust in adobe as a company and an attendant rise in anxiety among their customers users noted that they have not always wanted nor could they afford to upgrade to the newest versions of the software and the new licensing was essentially forcing them to do this college officials expressed their concern with the new licensing terms worried about rising costs and have asked about switching to alternative products adobe vp of creative solutions responded that they expected a higher degree of this type of reaction from the hobbyist photographic community despite a storm of customer criticism over adobe s move to subscription only pricing the company announced that it would not sell perpetual licenses to its software alongside the subscriptions we understand this is a big change but we are so focused on the vision we shared for creative cloud and we plan to focus all our new innovation on

software creative cloud was hacked and its applications made illegally available a day after it officially launched however adobe claims that creative cloud will be more accessible and provide better value we believe in fighting piracy of software by making the right software for the right people at the right price the service has been criticized for its price which is higher in europe than in the us and according to adobe is based on customer research that assesses the value of the product in the local market critics noted that adobe lists 29 supported currencies whereas boxed versions could be installed in any of the world s 249 territories without issue current users of creative suite 3 and higher get discounts for the creative cloud service for a limited time after which the

effort facebook and evernote began notifying their users who used the same email addresses for their accounts as those compromised in the adobe breach according to an it expert adobe has failed its customers and should hang their heads in shame many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud software by subscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for non us customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the

a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them world war ii was a turning point wherein military affairs after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some 80 years first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them civilian life too changed in this direction by the 1950s corporations such as gm and many others were facing a new era of r d different from earlier ones less about genius inventors and individual inventions and more about organizational progress and integrated systems it raised new questions about where the capital economics capital for r d would come from in an era of limitless demand for r d although not necessarily for production alfred p sloan alfred sloan longtime ceo of gm 1920s to 1960s

distinction was always drawn in the 20th century between policies for the u s market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the u s was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the u s did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the u s the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in non u s markets than in the u s and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that

1971 by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random access memory chips however increased competition from japanese semiconductor manufacturers had by 1983 dramatically reduced the profitability of this market and the sudden success of the ibm personal computer convinced then ceo andrew grove to shift the company s focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model by the end of the 1980s this decision had proven successful buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to ibm and ibm s competitors within the rapidly growing ibm pc compatible personal computer market intel embarked on a 10 year period of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the pc industry by launching its intel inside marketing campaign in 1989 intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection so that by the end of the 1990s its line of pentium brand pentium processors had become a household name slowing demand and challenges to dominance after 2000 growth in demand for high end microprocessors slowed competitors notably amd intel s largest competitor in its primary x86 x86 architecture market

for a number of years been embroiled in litigation us law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology circuit layouts until the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 a law sought by intel and the semiconductor industry association sia during the late 1980s and 1990s after this law was passed intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the intel 80386 80386 cpu the lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills even if intel lost the suits the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field in 2008 intel had another tick when it introduced the penryn microarchitecture which was 45 nbsp

intel began a pilot project with zte corporation to produce smartphones using the intel atom processor for china s domestic market this project is intended to challenge the domination of arm processors in mobile phones december 2011 intel announced that it reorganized several of its business units to form a new mobile and communications group this group will be responsible for the company s smartphone tablet and wireless efforts and will be headed by hermann eul and mike bell opening up the foundries finding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the ultrabook to gain market traction and with pc sales declining in 2013 intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for altera using 14 nm process general manager of intel s custom foundry division sunit rikhi indicated that intel would pursue further such deals in the future this was after poor sales of windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers except for qualcomm which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer apple as of july 2013 five companies will use intel s fabs via the intel custom foundry division achronix tabula company tabula netronome microsemi and altera most are fpga makers but netronome designs network processors only achronix began shipping chips made by intel using the 22 nm tri gate process several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time the alliance for affordable internet a4ai was launched in october 2013 and intel is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes facebook google and microsoft led by sir tim berners lee the a4ai seeks to make internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world where only 31 of people are online google will help to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the un broadband commission s worldwide target of 5 of monthly income product and market history srams and the microprocessor intel s first products were shift register memory and random access primary storage memory integrated circuits and intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive dynamic random access memory dram static random access memory sram and read only memory rom markets throughout the 1970s concurrently intel engineers marcian hoff federico faggin stanley mazor and masatoshi shima invented intel s first microprocessor originally developed for the japanese company busicom to replace a number of application specific integrated circuit asics in a calculator already produced by busicom the intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on november 15 1971 though the microprocessor did not become the core of intel s business until the mid 1980s note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almost simultaneous invention of the microprocessor from dram to microprocessors in 1983 at the dawn of the personal computer era intel s profits came under increased pressure from japanese memory chip manufacturers and then president andy grove focused the company on microprocessors grove described this transition in the book only the paranoid survive a key element of his plan was the notion then considered radical of becoming the single source for successors to the popular intel 8086 8086 microprocessor until then the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier but grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as zilog and advanced micro devices amd when the pc industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s intel was one of the primary beneficiaries intel x86 processors and the ibm pc image 153056995 5ef8b01016 o jpg right thumb 230px the die integrated circuit die from an intel 8742 an 8 bit microcontroller that includes a cpu running at 12 mhz 128 bytes of ram 2048 bytes of eprom and input output i o in the same chip despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor the intel 4004 4004 and its successors the intel 8008 8008 and the intel 8080 8080 were never major revenue contributors at intel as the next processor the 8086 and its variant the 8088 was completed in 1978 intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed operation crush and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible one design win was the newly created ibm pc division though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time ibm introduced its personal computer in 1981 and it was rapidly successful in 1982 intel created the intel 80286 80286 microprocessor which two years later was used in the ibm pc at compaq the first ibm pc clone manufacturer produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first intel 80386 80386 based system beating ibm and establishing a competitive market for pc compatible systems and setting up intel as a key component supplier in 1975 the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32 bit microprocessor finally released in 1981 as the intel iapx 432 the project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives and it failed in the marketplace intel extended the x86 x86 architecture to 32 bits instead 386 microprocessor during this period andrew grove dramatically redirected the company closing much of its dram business and directing resources to the microprocessor business of perhaps greater importance was his decision to single source the 386 microprocessor prior to this microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production interrupting supplies to customers to mitigate this risk these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply the 8080 and 8086 series microprocessors were produced by several companies notably amd grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories santa clara california santa clara california hillsboro oregon hillsboro oregon and chandler arizona chandler a suburb of phoenix arizona phoenix arizona he convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery as the success of compaq s deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant cpu choice intel achieved a position of near exclusive dominance as its supplier profits from this funded rapid development of both higher performance chip designs and higher performance manufacturing capabilities propelling intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s 486 pentium and itanium intel introduced the intel 80486 486 microprocessor in 1989 and in 1990 formally established a second design team designing the processors code named p5 and p6 in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken engineers vinod dham and rajeev chandrasekhar member of parliament india were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later intel s signature pentium chip the p5 was earlier known as operation bicycle referring to the cycles of the processor the p5 microarchitecture p5 was introduced in 1993 as the intel pentium brand pentium substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number numbers such as 486 are hard to register as a trademark the p6 followed in 1995 as the pentium pro and improved into the pentium ii in 1997 new architectures were developed alternately in santa clara california and hillsboro oregon the santa clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 x86 architecture codenamed p7 the first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with hewlett packard engineers though intel soon took over primary design responsibility the resulting implementation of the itanium ia 64 64 bit architecture was the itanium finally introduced in june 2001 the itanium s performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations and it failed to compete effectively with x86 64 which was amd s 64 bit extensions to the original x86 architecture intel uses the name intel 64 previously em64t as of 2012 intel continues to develop and deploy the itanium known planning continues into 2014 the hillsboro team designed the pentium 4 willamette willamette processors initially code named p68 which were marketed as the pentium 4 pentium flaw in june 1994 intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating point math subsection of the p5 microarchitecture p5 pentium pentium microprocessor under certain data dependent conditions the low order bits of the result of a floating point division would be incorrect the error could compound in subsequent calculations intel corrected the error in a future chip revision but nonetheless declined to disclose it in october 1994 dr thomas nicely professor of mathematics at lynchburg college independently discovered the software bug bug he contacted intel but received no response on october 30 he posted a message on the internet word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press the bug was easy to replicate a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system consequently many users did not accept intel s statements that the error was minor and not even an erratum during thanksgiving in 1994 the new york times ran a piece by journalist john markoff spotlighting the error intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip quickly putting in place a large end user technical support support organization this resulted in a 500 nbsp million charge against intel s 1994 revenue ironically the pentium flaw incident intel s response to it and the surrounding media coverage propelled intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name dovetailing with an uptick in the intel inside campaign the episode is considered to have been a positive event for intel changing some of its business practices to be more end user focused and generating substantial public awareness while avoiding a lasting negative impression needs page number intel inside and other 1990s programs during this period intel undertook two major supporting programs the first is widely known the 1991 intel inside marketing and branding campaign the idea of ingredient branding was new at the time with only nutrasweet and a few others making attempts to do so this campaign established intel which had been a component supplier little known outside the pc industry as a household name the second program is little known intel s systems group began in the early 1990s manufacturing pc motherboards the main board component of a personal computer and the one into which the processor cpu and memory ram chips are plugged shortly after intel began manufacturing fully configured white box systems for the dozens of pc clone companies that rapidly sprang up at its peak in the mid 1990s intel manufactured over 15 of all pcs making it the third largest supplier at the time during the 1990s intel s intel

personal computer pc demand growth beginning in 2000 and the rise of the low cost pc by the end of the 1990s microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that cpu power aside from high end server systems and software whose demand dropped with the end of the dot com bubble consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low cost systems after 2000 intel s strategy of producing ever more powerful processors and obsoleting their predecessors stumbled leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors notably amd this in turn lowered the profitability of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the pc hardware by intel intel s dominance in the x86 microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years including federal trade commission ftc investigations in both the late 1980s and in 1999 and civil actions such as the 1997 suit by digital equipment corporation dec and a patent suit by intergraph intel s market dominance at one time it controlled over 85 of the market for 32 bit x86 microprocessors combined with intel s own hardball legal tactics such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus pc manufacturers made it an attractive target for litigation but few of the lawsuits ever amounted to anything a case of industrial espionage arose in 1995 that involved both intel and amd bill gaede an argentina argentine formerly employed both at amd and at intel s chandler arizona arizona plant was arrested for attempting in 1993 to sell the i486 and p5 microarchitecture p5 pentium designs to amd

into various lawsuits with that company nintendo decided instead to take a risk and bring their console to north america on their own while cutting pal manufacturing and marketing costs by entering into a deal with mattel mattel had previously made the intellivision in 1979 and had some experience in the video games industry at that time nintendo had in a previous incarnation also been a toy manufacturer and the two companies believed they had much in common after the system became a huge success in america this deal was later considered a mistake in hindsight by nintendo as the mattel

console the intellivision after this failed the company formed a deal with nintendo in order to bring the nintendo entertainment system to the pal regions this was later believed to have been a

certification program marketing sales practices in 1990 oracle laid off 10 about 400 people of its work force because of accounting errors this became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice and also settled out of court class action class action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings ellison stated in 1992 that oracle had made an incredible business mistake competition although ibm dominated the mainframe relational database market with its db2 and sql ds database products it delayedentering the market for a relational database on unix and windows operating systems this left the door open for sybase oracle and informix corporation informix and eventually microsoft to dominate mid range and microcomputers around this time oracle technology started to lag technically behind that of sybase in 1990 1993 sybase became the fastest growing database company and the database industry s darling vendor but soon fell victim to its merger mania and to technical issues with system x sybase s 1993 merger with powersoft resulted in its losing its focus on its core database technology in 1993 sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the windows operating system to microsoft corporation which markets it under the name sql server in 1994 informix overtook sybase and became oracle s most important rival the intense war between informix ceo phil white and ellison made front page news in silicon valley for three years informix claimed that oracle had hired away informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product informix finally dropped its lawsuit against oracle in 1997 in november 2005 a book detailing the war between oracle and informix was published titled the real story of informix software and phil white it gave a detailed chronology of the battle of informix against oracle and how informix software s ceo phil white landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking ellison once it had overcome informix and sybase oracle corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until use of microsoft sql server became widespread in the late 1990s and ibm acquired informix software in 2001 to complement its db2 database oracle competes for new database licenses on unix linux and windows operating systems primarily against ibm s db2 and microsoft sql server which only runs on windows ibm s db2 dominates the mainframe database market in 2004 oracle s sales grew at a rate of 14 5 to 6 2 nbsp billion giving it 41 3 and the top share of the relational database market informationweek march 2005 with market share estimated at up to 44 6 in 2005 by some

postgresql has made inroads by proclaiming that its product delivers oracle compatibility features at a much lower price point in the software applications market oracle corporation primarily competes against sap ag sap on march 22 2007 oracle sued sap accusing them of fraud and unfair competition in the market for business intelligence software many other software companies small and large have successfully competed in quality with oracle and sap products business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the big four consolidated bi firms such as oracle who has entered bi market through a recent trend of acquisitions including hyperion solutions and the independent pure play vendors such as microstrategy actuate corporation actuate and sas institute inc sas oracle and sap from 1988 oracle corporation and the german company sap ag had a decade long history of cooperation beginning with the integration of sap s sap r 3 r 3 enterprise application suite with oracle s relational database products the marketplace regarded the two firms products as complementing one another rather than as substitutes despite the current when sap partnership with microsoft and the increasing integration of sap applications with microsoft products such as microsoft sql server a competitor to oracle database oracle and sap continue their cooperation according to oracle corporation the majority of sap s customers use oracle databases in years however competition between oracle and sap has increased and as a result the rivalry between the two companies has grown even developing into a feud between the co founders of the two companies where one party would frequently voice strong negative comments about the other company in 2004 oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise applications market in 1989 oracle had already released oracle financials a series of acquisitions by oracle corporation began most notably those of peoplesoft siebel systems and hyperion solutions hyperion sap recognized that oracle had started to become a competitor in a market where sap had the leadership and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that oracle corporation had acquired sap would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications oracle corporation would resort to a similar strategy by advising sap customers to get off sap a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform oracle fusion for sap and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to sap customers who chose oracle corporation products oracle and sap the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary tomorrownow compete in the third party enterprise software maintenance and support market on march 22 2007 oracle filed a lawsuit against sap in oracle corporation v sap ag oracle alleged that tomorrownow which provides discount support for legacy oracle product lines used the accounts of former oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from oracle s website and to appropriate them for sap s use some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by oracle corporation to decrease competition with sap in the market for third party enterprise software maintenance and support on july 3 2007 sap admitted that tomorrownow employees had made inappropriate downloads from the oracle support web site however it claims that sap personnel and sap customers had no access to oracle intellectual property via tomorrownow sap s ceo henning kagermann stated that even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective we regret very much that this occurred additionally sap announced that it had instituted changes in tomorrownow s operational oversight on november 23 2010 a united states district court for the northern district of california u s district court jury in oakland california found that sap ag must pay oracle corp 1 3 nbsp billion for copyright infringement awarding damages that could be the largest ever for copyright infringement while admitting liability sap estimated the damages at no more than 40 nbsp million while oracle claimed that they are at least 1 65 nbsp billion the awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in u s legal history sap said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal on september 1 2011 a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial calling oracle s original award grossly excessive oracle chose a new trial on august 3 2012 sap and oracle agreed on a judgment for 306 million in damages pending approval from the u s district court judge to save time and expense of a new trial after the accord has been approved oracle can ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the earlier jury verdict in addition to the damages payment sap has already paid oracle 120 million for its legal fees slogans information driven for the oracle database can t break it can t break in and unbreakable the information company as of 2010 software hardware complete as of late 2010 hardware and software engineered to work together media oracle corporation produces and distributes the oracle clearview series of videos as part of its marketing mix controversies trashgate in 2000 oracle gained attention from the computer industry and the press after hiring private investigators to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an united states v microsoft antitrust trial involving microsoft the chairman of oracle corporation larry ellison staunchly defended his company s hiring of an east coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival microsoft corporation during its antitrust trial calling the snooping a public service the investigation reportedly included a 1 200 offer to janitors at the association for competitive technology to look through microsoft s trash asked how he d feel if others were looking into oracle s business activities ellison said we will ship our garbage to redmond and they can go through it we believe in full disclosure can break it can break in at one point oracle corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan can t break it can t break in or unbreakable this signifies a demand on information security oracle corporation also stresses the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points however two weeks after its introduction in 2002 david litchfield alexander kornbrust cesar cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against oracle products commentators criticized the slogan as unrealistic and as an invitation to security cracking crackers but oracle corporation s chief security officer mary ann davidson portrayed the criticism as unfair rather than representing a literal claim of oracle s products impregnability she saw the campaign in the context of fourteen independent security evaluations that oracle corporation s database server had passed relationship with john ashcroft in 2004 then united states attorney general john ashcroft sued oracle corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multi billion dollar intelligence contract after ashcroft s resignation from government he founded a lobbying firm the ashcroft group which oracle hired in 2005 with the group s help oracle went on to acquire the contract expeditionary combat support system computer sciences corporation reportedly spent a billion dollars developing a computer

the specialized performance criteria events acquisition of sun microsystems on january 27 2010 oracle announced it had completed its acquisition of sun microsystems valued at more than 7 nbsp billion a move that transformed oracle from solely a software company to a manufacturer of both software and hardware the acquisition was delayed for several months by the eu commission because of concerns about mysql but was unconditionally approved in the end this acquisition was important to some in the open source community and also to some other companies as they feared oracle might end sun s traditional support of open source projects since the acquisition oracle has discontinued opensolaris and staroffice and sued google over their newly acquired java programming language java patents from sun in september 2011 a wikileaks cable was published revealing that the u s pressured the e u to allow oracle to acquire sun justice department lawsuit on july 29 2010 the united states

where spending has stayed strong despite economic turmoil in other sectors it s also primed for growth in the united states where it s the focus of major government reform efforts lawsuit against google on august 12 2010 oracle announced a lawsuit against google concerning patent and copyright infringement of java programming language java in google s development of android operating system android oracle claimed that google s android competes with oracle america s java and that google has been aware of sun s patent portfolio since google hired certain former sun java engineers oracle acquired the java patents when it bought sun microsystems in january 2010 google s reimplementation of the java platform supports most java functionality apart from abstract window toolkit awt and swing java swing instead supplying a native widget toolkit oracle originally sought damages up to 6 1 billion but this valuation was rejected by a federal judge who asked oracle to revise the estimate in may 2012 the jury in this case found that google did not infringe on oracle s patents and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the java apis used by google was not copyrightable on september 5 2012 oracle was ordered by a federal judge to pay google s legal fees which were over 1 million google has accused apple oracle and microsoft of trying to take down android through patent litigation rather than innovating and competing with better products and services in august 2011 google started the process of purchasing motorola mobility for usd us 12 5 billion which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect android since motorola mobility holds more than 17 000 patents in late may 2012 it successfully completed acquisition of the company thus adding its patents portfolio virtually unto its own as a potential defensive measure google has also acquired thousands of patents from ibm discontinuation of opensolaris on august 13 2010 an internal oracle memo leaked to the

sales in 2004 wal mart responded by testing its own dollar store concept a subsection of some stores called pennies n cents wal mart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets for example in germany it had captured just 2 percent of the german food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained a secondary player behind aldi with a 19 percent share when in july

shoppers people who like low prices and cannot afford much more economic impact kenneth stone professor of economics at iowa state university in a paper published in farm foundation in 1997 found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a wal mart store opening a loyola university chicago study suggested that the impact a wal mart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from that store the leader of that study admits that this factor is stronger in smaller towns and doesn t apply to more urban areas saying it d be so tough to nail down what s up with wal mart a 2004 paper by two professors at pennsylvania state university found that u s counties with wal mart stores suffered increased poverty compared with counties without wal marts they hypothesized that this could be due to the displacement of workers from higher paid jobs in the retailers customers no longer choose to patronize wal mart providing less local charity than the replaced businesses or a shrinking pool of local leadership and reduced social capital due to a reduced number of local independent businesses a june 2006 article published by the libertarianism libertarian ludwig von mises institute suggested that wal mart has a positive impact on small business it argued that while wal mart s low prices caused some existing businesses to close the chain also created new opportunities for other small business and so the process of creative destruction unleashed by wal mart has no statistically significant impact on the overall size of the small business sector in the united states the economic policy institute estimates that between 2001 and 2006 wal mart s trade deficit with china alone eliminated nearly 200 000 u s jobs another

mart costs about 50 retail jobs among competitors for every 100 jobs wal mart creates in terms of economic effects will states that wal mart and its effects save shoppers more than 200 billion a year dwarfing such government programs as supplemental nutrition assistance program food stamps 28 6 billion and the earned income tax credit 34 6 billion a 2001 mckinsey company mckinsey global institute study of u s labor productivity growth between 1995 and 2000 concluded that wal mart directly and indirectly caused the bulk of the productivity acceleration in the retail sector robert solow a nobel laureate in economics and an adviser to the study stated that by far the most important factor in that growth is wal mart big data analytics as the largest retailer in the us walmart collects and analyzes an enormous amount of data on consumer s shopping habits the big data sets are data mining mined for use in predictive analytics which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting

relations board nlrb announced that it had found that in 13 u s states wal mart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on black friday had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes critics point to walmart s high turnover employment turnover rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce although other factors may be involved approximately 70 of its employees leave within the first year despite the turnover rate the company still is able to affect unemployment rates this was found in a study by oklahoma state university which states walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio economic variables were taken into account wal mart is the largest employer in the united states employing almost five times as many people as ibm the second largest employer in the u s gender and sexual orientation in

the united states united states supreme court ruled in wal mart s favor stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class the court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of the plaintiffs circumstances the class action could not proceed as presented and furthermore in a 5 4 decision that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit however several plaintiffs including ms dukes still intend to file individual discrimination lawsuits separately according to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit in 2001 wal mart s eeoc

groups of minority female and gay employees that meet at wal mart headquarters in bentonville to advise the company on marketing and internal promotion there are seven business resource groups women african americans hispanics asians native americans gays and lesbians and a disabled group charity founder sam walton held the belief that the company s contribution to society was the fact that it operated efficiently thereby lowering the cost of living for its customers and therefore in that sense was a powerful force for good despite his refusal to contribute cash to philanthropic causes having begun to feel that his wealth attracted people who wanted nothing more than a handout he explained that while he believed his family had been fortunate and wished to use his wealth to aid worthy causes like education they could not be expected to solve every personal problem that comes to their attention he explained later in his autobiography we feel very strongly that wal mart really is not and should not be in the charity business stating any debit has to be passed along to somebody either shareholders or our customers since sam walton s death in 1992 however walmart and the walmart foundation dramatically increased charitable giving in 2008 forbes ranked wal mart stores at 6th place when evaluating donations by corporations as a percentage of income criticism wal mart

important elements of personal computing such as the desktop metaphor graphical user interface gui the computer mouse and desktop computing these features were frowned upon by the then board of

the prince of wales history file xerox 914 jpg thumb 200px left the xerox 914 was the first one piece plain paper photocopier and sold in the millions xerox was founded in 1906 in rochester as the haloid photographic company which originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment in 1938 chester carlson a physicist working independently invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged drum and dry powder toner joseph c wilson entrepreneur joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlson s invention and in 1946 signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as president ceo of xerox until 1967 and served as chairman until his death in 1971 looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in 1958 and then simply xerox in 1961 before releasing the 914 xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype hand operated equipment known as the flat plate 1385 the 1385 was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressograph addressograph multigraph multilith 1250 and related sheet fed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photo flood lighting and timer the glass film plate had been replaced with a selenium coated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offset s market share the 1385 was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in 1955 the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce the 1824 microfilm printer at about half the size and weight this still sizable machine printed onto hand fed cut sheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars a scaled down version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the 813 desktop copier the xerox 914 the company came to prominence in 1959 with the introduction of the xerox 914 the most successful single product of all time the 914 the first paper plain paper photocopier was developed by carlson and john h dessauer it was so popular that by the end of 1961 xerox had almost 60 million in revenue revenues leaped to over 500 million by 1965 1960s the company expanded substantially throughout the 1960s making millionaires of some long suffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research and development phase of the product in 1960 a xerography research facility called the wilson center for research and technology was opened in webster town new york webster new york in 1961 the company changed its name to xerox corporation xerox common stock xrx was listed on the new york stock exchange in 1961 and on the chicago stock exchange in 1990 in 1963 xerox introduced the xerox 813 the first desktop plain paper copier realizing carlson s vision of a copier that could fit on anyone s office desk ten years later in 1973 a basic analogue color copier based on the 914 followed the 914 itself was gradually sped up to become the 420 and 720 the 813 was similarly developed into the 330 and 660 products and eventually also the 740 desktop microfiche printer xerox s first foray into duplicating as distinct from copying was with the xerox 2400 introduced in 1966 2400 denoted the number of prints produced in an hour although still some way short of offset speeds this machine introduced the industry s first automatic document feeder slitter perforator and collator sorter this product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the xerox 3600 duplicator meanwhile a small lab team was borrowing 914 copiers and modifying them the lab was working on a project called the long distance xerography ldx project the aim was to be able to connect two copiers together via the public telephone network such that a document scanned on one machine would be copied out on the other the ldx system was introduced in 1964 many years later this work came to fruition in the xerox telecopiers seminal to today s fax machines the fax operation in today s multifunction copiers is true to carlson s original vision for these devices charles peter mccolough c peter mccolough a longtime executive of haloid and xerox took over as ceo from joseph wilson in 1968 in 1968 the company consolidated its headquarters at xerox square in downtown rochester with its iconic 30 story xerox tower in 2007 the headquarters was moved to stamford

increase their productivity it was twice a fast as the 3600 duplicator at two impressions per second 7200 per hour it was followed by the 9400 which did auto duplexing and then by the 9500 which offered zoom reduction in a 1975 super bowl advertising super bowl commercial for the 9200 xerox debuted an advertising campaign featuring brother dominic a monk who used the 9200 system to save decades of manual copying dominic portrayed by jack eagle became the face of xerox into the 1980s following these years of record profits in 1975 xerox resolved an anti trust suit with the united states federal trade commission ftc which at the time was under the direction of frederic m scherer the xerox consent decree resulted in the forced licensing of the company s entire patent portfolio mainly to japanese competitors within four years of the consent decree xerox s share of the u s copier market dropped from nearly 100 to less than 14 in 1979 xerox purchased western union as the basis for its proposed xerox telecommunications network xten for local loop communications however after three years the company decided the idea was a mistake and sold its assets to mci communications mci

disentangled xerox from the financial services industry development of digital photocopiers in the 1990s and a revamp of the entire product range again gave xerox a technical lead over its competitors digital photocopiers were essentially high end laser printers with attached scanners known as multi function machines or just mfms which were able to be attached to computer networks xerox worked to turn its product into a service providing a complete document service to companies including supply maintenance configuration and user support to reinforce this image in 1994 the company introduced a corporate signature the document company above its main logo and introduced a red digital x the digital x symbolized the transition of documents between the paper and digital worlds in the mid 1990s la county superior court turned to xerox for help in replacing nearly 500 aging copiers throughout la county but xerox refuse to consider leasing the county instead went to konica and introduced the concepts leasing of copiers for the first time in the industry xerox was shut out of the county for the next two years in april 1999 allaire was succeeded by g richard thoman richard thoman who had

cash and continuing to invest in research and development in 2000 xerox acquired tektronix color printing and imaging division in wilsonville oregon for us 925 million this led to the current xerox phaser line of products as well as xerox solid ink printing technology in september 2004 xerox celebrated the 45th anniversary of the xerox 914 more than 200 000 units were made around the world between 1959 and 1976 the year production of the 914 was stopped today the 914 is part of american history as an artifact in the smithsonian institution in november 2006 xerox completed the

systems for 32 5 million in cash digital printing the laser printer was invented in 1969 by xerox researcher gary starkweather by modifying a xerox copier xerox management was afraid the product version of starkweather s invention which became the 9700 would negatively impact their copier business so the innovation sat in limbo until ibm launched the ibm 3800 3800 laser printer in 1976 the first commercial non impact printer was the xerox 1200 introduced in 1973 based on the 3600 copier it had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer phil chen in 1977 following ibm s laser printer introduction the xerox 9700 was introduced laser printing eventually became a multi billion dollar business for xerox in the late 1970s xerox introduced the xerox 350 color slide system this product allowed the customer to create digital word and graphic 35mm slides many of the concepts used in today s photo shop programs were pioneered with this technology in 1980 xerox announced the forward looking 5700 laser printing system a much smaller version of their 9700 but with revolutionary touch screen capabilities and multiple media input word processing disks ibm magcards etc and printer finishing options this product was allegedly never intended to make the commercial markets due to its development cost but rather to show the innovation of xerox it did take off with many customers but was soon replaced with its still smaller and lower cost xerox 2700 2700 distributed electronic printer offering in 1982 palo alto research center file xerox alto jpg thumb 250px right the xerox alto workstation was developed at xerox parc in 1970 under company president charles peter mccolough c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printer laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in 1973 a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathode ray type screen mouse type pointing device and a qwerty type alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xerox s own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xerox s own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in 1979 steve jobs made a deal with xerox s venture capital division he would let them invest 1 million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp computing wimp window icon menu and pointing device system and redirected development of the apple lisa to incorporate these technologies jobs is quoted as saying they just had no idea what they had in 1980 jobs invited several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in 1981 xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star xerox 8010 star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display window based gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and e mail the xerox 6085 star despite its technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing 16 000 per unit a typical xerox star based office complete with network and printers would have cost 100 000 in the mid 1980s apple inc apple considered buying xerox however a deal was never reached apple instead bought rights to the alto gui and adapted it into to a more affordable personal computer aimed towards the business and education markets the apple macintosh was released in 1984 and was the first personal computer to popularize the gui and mouse amongst the public in 2002 parc was spun off into an independent wholly

reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than 2 billion on april 11 2002 the u s securities and exchange commission filed a complaint against xerox the complaint alleged xerox deceived the public between 1997 and 2000 by employing several accounting maneuvers the most significant of which was a change in which xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases recognizing a sale when a lease contract was signed instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract at issue was when the revenue was recognized not the validity of the revenue xerox s restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized on december 20 2002 xerox corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its non cash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements resulted in after tax understatement of interest expense of approximately 5 million to 6 million or less than 1 cent per share in each of the

1 4 billion gap in pre tax earnings in april 2005 kpmg settled with the sec by paying a us 22 48 million fine meanwhile xerox paid a civil penalty of 10 million as part of the settlement kpmg neither admits nor denies wrongdoings during settlement with the securities and exchange commission xerox began to revamp itself once more as a symbol of this transformation the relative size of the word xerox was increased in proportion to the document company on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in september 2004 along with the digital x however the digital x and the document company were still used by fuji xerox until april 2008 trademark the word xerox is a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for example i xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a genericized trademark generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written no publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot xerox a document but you can copy it on a xerox brand copying machine xerox corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categories despite their efforts many dictionaries continue to include the use of xerox as a verb including the oxford english dictionary see also notes references david owen author david

curtis priem previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at sun microsystems the founders gained venture capital funding from sequoia capital major releases and acquisitions the autumn of 1999 saw the release of the geforce 256 nv10 most notably introducing on board transform clipping and lighting transformation and lighting t l to consumer level 3d hardware running at 120 nbsp mhz and featuring four pixel pipelines it implemented advanced video acceleration motion compensation and hardware sub picture alpha blending the geforce outperformed existing products by a wide margin due to the success of its products nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for microsoft s xbox console xbox game console which earned nvidia a 200 million advance however the project drew the time of many of nvidia s best engineers away from other projects in the short term this did not matter and the geforce 2 series geforce2 gts shipped in the summer of 2000 in 2000 nvidia acquired the intellectual assets of its one time rival 3dfx interactive 3dfx one of the biggest graphics companies of the mid to late 1990s in july 2002 nvidia acquired exluna for an

free and open source software support until nvidia has not published any documentation for its hardware meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open source device driver for nvidia s products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering instead nvidia provides its own binary file binary geforce graphics drivers for x org server x org and a thin open source library that interfaces with the linux kernel linux freebsd or solaris operating system solaris kernels and the proprietary software proprietary graphics software nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open source driver that only supports two dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the x org server x org distribution the proprietary nature of nvidia s drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free software free software community communities some linux and bsd users insist on using only open source drivers and regard nvidia s insistence on providing nothing more than a binary only driver as wholly inadequate given that competing manufacturers like intel corporation intel offer support and documentation for open source open source developers and that others like advanced micro devices amd release partial documentation and provide some active development because of the closed nature of the drivers nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that nvidia only provides x86 x64 driver builds as a result support for 3d graphics acceleration in linux on powerpc does not exist nor does support for linux on the hypervisor restricted ps3 playstation 3 console some users claim that nvidia s linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations restatement on february 14 2002 the company restated the financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal

for more information refer to the semiconductor sales leaders by year some of its main competitors include microchip technology cypress semiconductor integrated device technology qualcomm samsung electronics and xilinx ti has the largest market share in the analog semiconductor industry which has an estimated market tam exceeding us 37 billion ti is reported to have 14 of the market leading ahead of competitors st microelectronics infineon and nxp semiconductors according to latest reports from gartner educational technology texas instruments produces a range of calculators with the ti 30 being one of the most popular early calculators ti has also developed a line of graphing calculators the first being the ti 81 and most popular being the ti 83 plus with the ti 84 plus being an updated equivalent there are many ti calculators still selling without graphing capabilities the ti 30 has been replaced by the ti 30 ti 30x iis there are some financial calculators for sale on the ti website in 2007 ti released the ti nspire family of calculators as well as computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators texas instruments calculator community in the 1990s with the advent of ti s graphing calculator series programming became popular among some students the ti 8x series of calculators beginning with the ti 81 came with a built in basic interpreter through which simple programs could be created the ti 85 was the first ti calculator to allow assembly language assembly programming via a shell called zshell and the ti 83 was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assembly based programs rival what one might find on a game boy or personal digital assistant pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculator relevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the now defunct ti files and still active ticalc org the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early 2000s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to 100 programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z80 and those running on the motorola 68000 series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed brute force attack brute force to find the keys and publish them in 2009 ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas instruments signing key controversy enthusiasts had already been creating their own operating systems before the finding of the keys which could be installed with other methods industry recognition in 2007 texas instruments was awarded the manufacturer of the year for global supply chain excellence by world trade magazine in six consecutive years 2007 through 2012 ti made it to the list of most ethical companies in the

campus in san jose 1984 1995 early years cisco systems was founded in december 1984 by two members of stanford university computer support staff leonard bosack who was in charge of the computer science department s computers and sandy lerner who managed the graduate school of business computers despite founding cisco in 1984 bosack along with kirk lougheed continued to work at stanford on cisco s first product which consisted of exact replicas of stanford s blue box router and a stolen copy of the university s multiple protocol router computing router software originally written some years earlier at stanford medical school by william yeager a stanford research engineer nbsp which they adapted into what became the foundation for cisco ios on july 11 1986 bosack and kirk lougheed were forced to resign from stanford and the university contemplated filing criminal complaints against cisco and its founders for the theft of its software hardware designs and other intellectual properties in 1987 stanford licensed the router software and two computer boards to cisco in addition to bosack lerner and lougheed greg satz a programmer and richard troiano who handled sales completed the early cisco team the company s first ceo was bill graves who held the position from 1987 to 1988 in 1988 john morgridge was appointed ceo the name cisco was derived from the city name san francisco which is why the company s engineers insisted on using the lower case cisco in its early years the logo is intended to depict the two towers of the golden gate bridge on february 16 1990 cisco systems went public with a market capitalization of 224 nbsp million and was listed on the nasdaq stock exchange on august 28 1990 lerner was fired upon hearing the news her husband bosack resigned in protest the couple walked away from cisco with 170 nbsp million 70 of which was committed to their own charity although cisco was not the first company to develop and sell dedicated network nodes it was one of the first to sell commercially successful routers supporting multiple network protocols classical cpu based architecture of early cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system cisco ios ios allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades some popular models of that time such as cisco 2500 managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged a rarity in high tech industry although cisco was strongly rooted in the enterprise environment the company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment entering the sp market with new high capacity product lines such as cisco 7000 and cisco 7500 between 1992 and 1994 cisco acquired several companies in ethernet switching such as kalpana company kalpana grand junction and most notably mario mazzola s crescendo communications which together formed the cisco catalyst catalyst business unit at the time the company envisioned network layer layer 3 routing and data link layer layer 2 ethernet token ring switching as complementary functions of different intelligence and architecture the former was slow and complex the latter was fast but simple this philosophy dominated the company s product lines throughout 1990s in 1995 john morgridge was succeeded by john chambers ceo john chambers 1996 2009 internet and silicon intelligence the phenomenal growth of the internet in mid to late 1990s quickly changed the telecom landscape as the internet protocol ip became widely adopted the importance of multi protocol routing declined nevertheless cisco managed to catch the internet wave with products ranging from modem access shelves as5200 to core cisco 12000 gsr routers that quickly became vital to internet service providers and by 1998 gave cisco de facto monopoly in this critical segment in late march 2000 at the height of the dot com bubble cisco became the most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization of more than us 500 nbsp billion in november 2011 with a market cap of about us 94 nbsp billion it is still one of the most valuable companies meanwhile the growth of internet bandwidth requirements kept challenging traditional software based packet processing architectures the perceived complexity of programming routing functions in silicon led to formation of several startups determined to find new ways to process internet protocol ip and mpls packets entirely in hardware and blur boundaries between routing and switching one of them juniper networks shipped their first product in 1999 and by 2000 chipped away about 30 from cisco sp market share cisco answered the challenge with homegrown asics and fast processing cards for cisco 12000 gsr routers and catalyst 6500 switches in 2004 cisco also started migration to new high end hardware cisco crs 1 crs 1 and software architecture ios xr 2006 2012 the human network as part of a massive rebranding campaign in 2006 cisco systems adopted the shortened name cisco and created the human network advertising campaign these efforts were meant to make cisco a household brand a strategy designed to support the low end linksys products and future consumer products such as flip video camera acquired by cisco in 2009 on the more traditional business side cisco continued to develop its extensive enterprise focused routing switching and security portfolio quickly growing importance of ethernet also influenced the company s product lines prompting the company to morph the successful catalyst 6500 ethernet switch into all purpose cisco 7600 routing platform however limits of cisco ios ios and aging crescendo architecture also forced cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier ethernet segment this resulted in a new asr9000 product family intended to consolidate company s carrier ethernet and subscriber management business around ezchip semiconductor ezchip based hardware and ios xr cisco also expanded into new markets by acquisition one example being a 2009 purchase of mobile specialist starent networks that resulted in asr5000 product line file cisco chennai jpg thumb 200 px a cisco facility in chennai india india is one of the company s largest overseas markets and production centers throughout the mid 2000s cisco also built a significant presence in india establishing its globalization centre east in bengaluru for 1 nbsp billion and planning that 20 of cisco s leaders would be based there however cisco continued to be challenged by both domestic alcatel lucent juniper networks and overseas competitors huawei due to lower than expected profit in 2011 cisco was forced to reduce annual expenses by 1 nbsp billion the company cut around 3 000 employees with an early retirement program who accepted buyout and planned to eliminate as many as 10 000 jobs around 14 percent of the 73 400 total employees before curtailment during the 2011 analyst call cisco s ceo john chambers called out several competitors by name including juniper and hp on 24 july 2012 cisco received approval from the eu to acquire nds a tv software developer for usd 5 billion this acquisition signaled the end of the the human network strategy as cisco found itself backing off from household hardware like linksys and flip into the cloud and software market 2013 present the internet of everything cisco launches its first global re branding campaign for the first time in six years with its tomorrow starts here and internet of everything advertising campaigns these efforts were designed to position cisco for the next ten years into a global leader in connecting the previously unconnected and facilitate the ip address connectivity of people data processes and things through cloud computing applications and services on july 23 2013 cisco systems announced a definitive agreement to acquire sourcefire for 2 7 billion on august 14 2013 cisco systems announced it is going to cut 4 000 jobs which is roughly 6 of the company starting in 2014 cisco systems has seen a huge drop in export sales because of spying fears from the american national security agency using backdoors in its products media and awards cisco products most notably ip phones and telepresence are frequently sighted in movies and tv series the company itself and its history was featured in the documentary film something ventured film something ventured which premiered in 2011 cisco was a 2002 03 recipient of the ron brown award a u s presidential honor to recognize companies for the exemplary quality of their relationships with employees and communities cisco commonly stays on top of fortune 100 best companies to work for with position no nbsp 20 in 2011 acquisitions cisco acquired a variety of companies to spin products and talent into the company in 1995 1996 the company completed 11 acquisitions several acquisitions such as stratacom were the biggest deals in the industry when they occurred during the internet boom in 1999 the company acquired cerent corporation a start up company located in petaluma california for about us 7 nbsp billion it was the most expensive acquisition made by cisco to that date and only the acquisition of scientific atlanta has been larger several acquired companies have grown into 1bn business units for cisco including lan switching enterprise voice over internet protocol voip platform webex and home networking the latter came as result of cisco acquiring linksys in 2003 and in 2010 was supplemented with new product line dubbed cisco valet cisco announced on january 4 2007 that it would buy ironport in a deal valued at us 830 million and completed the acquisition on june 25 2007 ironport was best known for its ironport antispam its senderbase email reputation service and its email security appliances accordingly ironport was integrated into the cisco security business unit ironport s senderbase was renamed as sensorbase to take account of the input into this database that other cisco devices provide sensorbase allows these devices to build a risk profile on ip addresses therefore allowing risk profiles to be dynamically created on http sites and smtp email sources cisco announced on march 15 2012 that it would acquire nds group for 5b the transaction was completed on july 30 2012 also in 2010 cisco became a key stakeholder in e skills week in march 2011 cisco completed the acquisition of privately held network configuration and change management software company pari networks although many buy ins such as crescendo networks in 1993 tandberg in 2010 resulted in acquisition of flagship technology to cisco many others have failed partially or completely for instance in 2010 cisco occupied a meaningful share of the packet optical market revenues were still not on par with us 7 nbsp billion price tag paid in 1999 for cerent corporation cerent some of acquired technologies such as flip from

through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain cisco s alleged monopoly in the network maintenance services market for cisco networking equipment cisco responded by accusing the person who filed the anti trust suit british born peter alfred adekeye with hacking and pressured the us government to extradite him from canada where he was giving evidence against cisco in an anti trust hearing canadian judge ronald mckinnon who oversaw the extradition hearing stated the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because alfred adekeye dared to take on a multinational giant he also condemned the us prosecutor for hiding the fact that alfred adekeye was in legal proceedings against cisco systems for stating that alfred adekeye had left the usa in a time period when he had not and a formal request for extradition was not filed against alfred adekeye when he was taken into custody judge mckinnon described the information provided by cisco and the us prosecutor as full of innuendo half truths and falsehoods adding that this speaks volumes for cisco s duplicity and accused them of unmitigated gall in using such a heavy handed move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure alfred adekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint remotely monitoring users connections cisco s linksys e2700 e3500 e4500 devices have been

holland short on funds had to part with his company and sell his interest to financier isaac leopold rice renaming the new firm as the electric boat electric boat company on 7 february 1899 holland effectively lost control of the company and found himself earning a salary of 90 a week as chief engineer while the company he founded was selling submarines for 300 000 each holland resigned from the company effective april 1904 rice became electric boat s first president remaining there from that time until 1915 when he stepped down just prior to his death on 2 november 1915 electric boat gained a reputation for unscrupulous arms dealing in 1904 05 when it sold submarines to japan s imperial japanese navy and russia s imperial russian navy who were then at war holland submarines were also sold to the british royal navy through the english armaments company vickers and to the dutch to serve in the royal netherlands navy the new pioneering craft originally developed by the company was now legitimized as genuine naval weapons by the world s most powerful navies in the post world war ii wind down electric boat was cash flush but lacking in work with its workforce shrinking from 13 000 to 4 000 by 1946 hoping to diversify the president and chief executive officer john jay hopkins started looking for companies that would fit into electric boat s market canadair purchase hopkins quickly found that canadair owned by the canadian government was suffering from similar post war malaise and was up for sale hopkins bought the company for 10 million in 1946 even by the canadian government s calculations the factory alone was worth more than 22 million excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts when electric boat purchased canadair its production line and inventory systems were in disorder hopkins hired canadian born mass production specialist h oliver west to take over the president s role and return canadair to profitability shortly after the takeover canadair began delivering its new canadair north star a version of the douglas dc 4 and was able to deliver aircraft to trans canada airlines canadian pacific airlines and british overseas airways corporation boac well in advance of their contracted delivery times as defense spending increased with the onset of the cold war canadair would go on to win many canadian military contracts for the royal canadian air force and became a major aerospace company these included canadair t 33 trainer the canadair argus long range maritime reconnaissance and military transport aircraft transport aircraft and the canadair f 86 sabre between 1950 and 1958 1 815 sabres were built canadair also produced 200 cf 104 starfighter supersonic fighter aircraft a licensed built version of the lockheed f 104 starfighter lockheed f 104 in 1976 canadair was sold back to the canadian government which sold it to bombardier inc in 1986 general dynamics emerges as the aircraft production at canadair became increasingly important to the company hopkins argued that the name electric boat was no longer appropriate on 24 april 1952 electric boat was reorganized as general dynamics general

saharan africa in 2001 families of the children as well as the governments of kano and nigeria filed lawsuits regarding the treatment representing the government is babatunde irukera according to news reports researchers did not obtain signed consent forms and medical personnel said pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug the lawsuits also accuse pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing as well as allegedly under dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of trovan pfizer denied these claims and subsequently produced an approval letter for testing from the nigerian ethics committee the nigerian government insisted that it was a fake and a panel of nigerian medical experts agreed that the letter had been concocted and backdated by the company s lead researcher in kano they went on to conclude that pfizer never obtained authorization from the nigerian government to give the unproven drug to children and infants in 2007 pfizer published a statement of defense letter the letter makes several claims including that pfizer donated 18 million in nigerian naira ngn about 216 000 in 1996 us dollars usd that the drug s oral form was presented as safer and easier to administer that the administration of trovan saved lives and that no unusual side

marketing their drugs bextra geodon and lyrica bcbs is reporting that pfizer used kickbacks and wrongly persuaded doctors to prescribe the drugs fiercepharma reported that according to the suit the

more than 5 000 healthcare professionals were entertained at meetings in bahamas virgin islands and across the u s the suit alleges pfizer has had similar cases brought against it which it has settled with the us federal government and with more than 40 us states pfizer denies the allegations wyeth s rapamune a whistleblower suit was filed in 2005 against wyeth which was acquired by pfizer alleging that the company illegally marketed their drug rapamune wyeth is targeted in the suit for off label marketing targeting specific doctors and medical facilities to increased sales of rapamune trying to get current transplant patients to change from their current transplant drugs to rapamune and for specifically targeting african americans according to the whistleblowers wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals with kickbacks to prescribe the drug in the form of grants donations and other money a us house of representatives committee led by rep edolphus towns is currently investigating these allegations brigham young university controversy arose over the drug celebrex brigham young university byu said that a professor of chemistry dr daniel simmons discovered an enzyme in the 1990s which would later lead towards the development of celebrex byu was originally seeking 15 royalty on sales which would equate to 9 7 billion the court filings show that a research agreement was made with monsanto later acquired by pfizer to develop a better aspirin the enzyme that dr simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems which celebrex is used to reduce those issues a battle ensued lasting over six years because byu claimed that pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while pfizer claims it had met all obligations in regards to the monsanto agreement this culminated in a 450 million amicable settlement without going to trial pfizer said it would take a 450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle

order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses members of the surrounding communities have stated that the epa has been coerced into accepting a plan that is affordable for pfizer but is not a complete proper remediation plan for the site detrimental to the interest of the community the epa has suggested a remediation plan that includes environmental caps and redeveloping a portion of it in the future this redevelopment will occur on the site which is located within a flood plain something the epa failed to address in their feasibility study released in early 2012 the mayor of bridgewater the new jersey department of environmental protection and other key community leaders also came out to endorse the plan without considering the amount of increased

dispatchers flight attendants ramp agents and operations agents are represented by the transport workers union twu impact on carriers southwest has been a major inspiration to other low cost carriers and its business model has been repeated many times around the world the competitive strategy combines high level of employee and aircraft productivity with low unit costs by reducing aircraft turn around time particularly at the gate europe s easyjet and ryanair are two of the best known airlines to follow southwest s business strategy in that continent other airlines with a business model based on southwest s system include canada s westjet malaysia s airasia the first and biggest lcc in asia qantas s jetstar airways jetstar although jetstar now operates three aircraft types philippines s cebu pacific thailand s nok air mexico s volaris and turkey turkey s pegasus airlines although southwest has been a major inspiration to many other airlines including ryanair airasia and jetstar the management strategies for example of ryanair airasia and jetstar differ significantly from those of southwest lobbying texas rail southwest has fought against the development of a high speed rail in the united states texas high speed rail system in texas in 1991 a plan was made to connect the texas triangle houston dallas san antonio with a privately financed high speed train system which would quickly take passengers from one city to the next this was the same model southwest airlines used 20 nbsp years earlier to break into the texas market where it served the same three cities southwest airlines with the help of lobbyists created legal barriers to prohibit the consortium from moving forward and the entire project was eventually scuttled in 1994 when the state of texas

2013 southwest does not use the more traditional spoke hub distribution paradigm hub and spoke flight routing system of most other major airlines preferring instead the point to point transit point to point system it has notably large operations in certain airports an average of 80 percent of southwest passengers are local passengers meaning only 20 percent of all passengers are connecting passengers this is significantly higher than most airlines where passengers often connect in hub cities however at southwest s focus cities the percentage of connecting passengers can reach 30 percent recent numbers indicate that the number of connecting passengers is steadily rising as part of its effort to control costs southwest sometimes uses secondary airports in cities which generally have high costs secondary airports generally have lower costs and may be more convenient to travelers than major airports to the same destinations for example southwest flies to chicago midway

inc and warner communications was announced on march 4 1989 during the summer of that same year paramount communications formerly gulf western launched a 12 2 billion hostile bid to acquire time inc in an attempt to end a stock swap merger deal between time and warner communications this caused time to raise its bid for warner to 14 9 billion in cash and stock paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a delaware court to block the time warner merger the court ruled twice in favor of time forcing paramount to drop both the time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of time warner which was completed on january 10 1990 1990s time warner subsequently acquired ted turner s turner broadcasting system in october 1996 not only did this result in the company in a way re entering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre 1950 film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution time warner purchased six flags theme parks chain in 1993 the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahoma based premier parks on april 1 1998 dick parsons already a director on the board since 1991 was hired as time warner president in 1995 although the division operational heads

officially filed on february 11 2000 employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december 14 2000 and gave final approval on january 11 2001 the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission due to the larger market capitalization of aol they would own 55 of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only 45 so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though aol had far less assets and revenues aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as co chief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slow moving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warner s high speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warner s branded magazines books music and movies this would have created 130 million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and subscriber slowdowns in part caused by the burst of the dot com bubble and the economic recession after september 2001 the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill accounting goodwill write off causing aol time warner to report a loss of 99 billion in 2002 at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from 226 billion to about 20 billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levin s ouster although case s coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001 effective in may 2002 although co coo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heir apparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo michael j kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parson s promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the old guard division heads who resisted pittman s synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july 4 2002 being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers in 2005 time warner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of 250 000 to the second inauguration of president george w bush on december 27 2007 newly

that is updated hourly effectively it is a best sellers list for the millions of products stocked by amazon while the asr has no direct effect on the sales of a product it is used by amazon to determine which products to include in their best sellers lists for competitive reasons amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public however amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the http en us nielsen com nielsen bookscan service to verified authors while the asr has been the source of much speculation by publishers manufacturers and marketers amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm in addition it states ref amazon technology customer relationship management crm and information management im support amazon s business strategy the core technology that keeps amazon running is linux based as of 2005 amazon had the world s three largest linux databases with capacities of 7 8 tb 18 5 tb and 24 7 tb the central data warehouse of amazon is made of 28 hewlett packard servers with four cpus per node running oracle database software amazon s technology architecture handles millions of back end operations every day as well as queries from more than half a million third party sellers with hundreds of thousands of people sending their credit card numbers to amazon s servers everyday security becomes a major concern amazon employs netscape secure commerce server using the secure socket layer protocol which stores all credit card details in a separate database the company also records data on customer buyer behavior which enables them to offer or recommend to an individual specific item or bundles of items based upon preferences demonstrated through purchases or items visited on january 31 2013 amazon experienced an outage that lasted approximately 49 minutes leaving its site inaccessible to some customers multi level sales strategy amazon employs a multi level e commerce strategy amazon started off by focusing on business to consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business to business relationships between itself and its suppliers but it then moved to incorporate customer to business transactions as it realized the value of customer reviews as part of the product descriptions it now also facilitates customer to customer with the provision of the amazon marketplace which act as an intermediary to facilitate consumer to consumer transactions the company lets almost anyone sell almost anything using its platform in addition to affiliate program that lets anybody post amazon links and earn a commission on click through sales there is now a program which let those affiliates build entire websites based on amazon s platform some other large e commerce sellers use amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites the sales are processed through amazon com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and amazon leases space for these retailers small sellers of used and new goods go to amazon marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price amazon also employs the use of drop shipping drop shippers or meta sellers these are members or entities that advertise goods on amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other amazon members these meta sellers may have millions of products listed have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time markup is anywhere from 50 to 100 and sometimes more these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true as amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years the resulting damage to a supply and demand marketplace remains to be seen but advertising contracts with large search engines eliminating smaller websites from overall exposure these practices should have a negative effect on the industry on the whole revenue over the last decade amazon has developed a customer base of around 30 million people amazon com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model amazon makes its money by taking a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website amazon also allows companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products controversies since its founding the company has attracted criticism and controversy from multiple sources over its actions these include luring customers away from the site s brick and mortar competitors poor warehouse conditions for workers anti unionization efforts amazon kindle remote

website lgbt book sales rank and works containing defamation libel facilitating dog fighting dogfight cockfight or pedophilia pedophile activities in december 2011 amazon faced backlash from small businesses for running a one day deal to promote its new price check app shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick and mortar store were offered a 5 discount to purchase the same item from amazon companies like groupon ebay and taap it countered amazon s promotion by offering 10 off from their products sales and use taxes sale of revisionist and holocaust denying books in october 2013 the world jewish congress called on amazon ceo jeff bezos to remove from its offer books that deny the holocaust and promote anti semitism or white supremacy no one should profit from the sale of such vile and offensive hate literature many holocaust survivors are deeply offended by the fact that the world s largest online retailer is making money from selling such material wjc executive vice president robert singer jewish leader robert singer wrote in a letter to bezos earlier a report in the british online magazine the kernel had revealed that amazon com was selling books that defend holocaust denial and shipped them even to customers in countries where holocaust denial is prohibited by the law alleged tax avoidance in the uk in november 2012 the uk government announced plans to investigate amazon com along with starbucks and google for tax avoidance as a result amazon has faced a backlash and boycott from the general public and other businesses in the uk internet piracy issues in china the chinese government is planning to increase regulation of amazon along with apple inc and taobao com in relation to internet piracy issues amazon has already had to shut down third party distributors due to pressure from the ncac alleged mistreatment of individual sellers amazon has faced scrutiny from numerous individual sellers who have claimed that amazon unexpectedly closed their accounts and subsequently withheld their funds for indefinite time frames according to section 5 k of the amazon seller s participation agreement amazon may earn interest on funds collected from buyers before they are disbursed to sellers meaning amazon can increase their earnings by delaying disbursement poor working conditions amazon has attracted widespread criticism by both current and former employees as well as the media and politicians for poor working conditions in fall 2011 it was publicized that at the breinigsville pennsylvania warehouse workers had to carry out work in heat resulting in employees becoming extremely uncomfortable and suffering from dehydration and collapse loading bay doors were not opened to allow in fresh air as managers were worried about theft amazon s initial response was to pay for an ambulance to sit outside on call to cart away overheated employees some workers pickers who travel the building with a trolley and a handheld scanner picking customer orders can walk up to 15 miles a day back and forward and if they fall behind on their targets they can be reprimanded the handheld scanners feed back to the employee real time information on how fast or slowly they are going and also serve to allow team leads and area managers to track the specific locations of employees and how much idle time they gain when not working in a german television report broadcast in february 2013 journalists diana l bl and peter onneken conducted a covert investigation at the distribution center of amazon in the town of bad hersfeld in the german state of hesse the report highlights the behavior of some of the security guards who apparently either had a neo nazism neo nazi background or deliberately dressed in neo nazi apparel and who were intimidating foreign and temporary female workers at its distribution centres amazon uk on 2 august 2013 the daily mail ran an expose outing amazon uk for employee gps tagging and subjecting them to harsh working conditions describing employees as human robots the newspaper said that amazon employed controversial zero hour contracts as a tool to reprimand staff a channel 4 documentary broadcast

small homepage http www monsanto com monsanto com monsanto company is a publicly traded american multinational corporation multinational chemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation headquartered in creve coeur missouri it is a leading producer of genetic engineering genetically engineered ge seed and of the herbicide glyphosate which it markets under the roundup herbicide roundup brand founded in 1901 by john francis queeny by the 1940s monsanto was a major producer of plastics including polystyrene and synthetic fibers notable achievements by monsanto and its scientists as a chemical company included breakthrough research on catalysis catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation and being the first company to mass produce light emitting diodes leds the company also formerly manufactured controversial products such as the insecticide ddt polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs agent orange and recombinant dna recombinant bovine somatotropin a k a bovine growth hormone monsanto was among the first to genetic modification genetically modify a plant cell along with three academic teams which was announced in 1983 and was among the first to conduct field trials of genetically modified crops which it did in 1987 it remained one of the top 10 u s chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002 through a process of mergers and spin offs that focused the company on biotechnology monsanto was a pioneer in applying the history of biotechnology biotechnology and industry biotechnology industry business model to agriculture using techniques developed by genentech and other biotech drug companies in the late 1970s in california in this business model companies invest heavily in research and development and recoup the expenses through the use and enforcement of biological patents monsanto s application of this model to agriculture along with a growing movement to create a global uniform system of plant breeders rights in the 1980s came into direct conflict with customary practices of farmers to save reuse share and develop plant varieties its seed patenting model has also been criticized as biopiracy and a threat to biodiversity monsanto s role in these changes in agriculture which include its litigation and its seed commercialization practices its current and former biotechnology products its lobbying of government agencies and its history as a chemical company have made monsanto controversial history in the beginning early 1900s saccharin and chemicals monsanto was founded in st louis missouri in 1901 by john francis queeny a 30 year veteran of the pharmaceutical industry he funded the start up with his own money and capital from a soft drink distributor and gave the company his wife s maiden name his father in law was emmanuel mendes de monsanto a wealthy financier of a sugar company active in vieques puerto rico and based in st thomas in the danish west indies the company s first product was the artificial sweetener saccharin monsanto expanded to europe in 1919 by entering a partnership with graesser s chemical works at cefn mawr near ruabon wales to produce vanillin aspirin and its raw ingredient salicylic acid and later rubber processing chemicals this site was later sold and closed in 2010 in the 1920s monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals like sulfuric acid and polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs and queeny s son edgar monsanto queeny took over the company in 1928 in 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called monsanto in illinois now known as sauget illinois sauget it was formed to provide a liberal regulatory environment and low taxes for the monsanto chemical plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules it was renamed in honor of leo sauget its first village president in 1936 monsanto acquired thomas hochwalt laboratories in dayton ohio in order to acquire the expertise of charles allen thomas and dr carroll a ted hochwalt and made it into monsanto s central research department thomas spent the rest of his career at monsanto until his retirement in 1970 during which time he served as president 1951 60 and chairman of the board 1960 65 in 1943 thomas was called to a meeting in washington dc with brig gen leslie groves commander of the manhattan project and with james conant president of harvard university and chairman of the national defense research committee ndrc they urged thomas to become co director of the manhattan project at los alamos with robert oppenheimer but thomas was reluctant to leave dayton and monsanto to that end monsanto operated the dayton project and later mound laboratories and assisted in the development of the first nuclear weapons in 1947 one of its factories was destroyed in the texas city disaster monsanto acquired american viscose from england s courtauld family in 1949 in 1954 monsanto partnered with german chemical giant bayer to form mobay and market polyurethanes in the united states monsanto began manufacturing ddt in 1944 along with some 15 other companies this insecticide was much welcomed in the fight against malaria transmitting mosquitoes due to ddt s toxicity its use in the united states was banned in 1972 in 1977 monsanto stopped producing pcbs the united states congress banned domestic pcb production two years later using this method knowles team designed the first industrial process to chirally synthesize an important compound l dopa l dopa which is currently the main drug used to treat parkinson s disease in 2001 knowles and ry ji noyori won the nobel prize in chemistry in the mid 1960s chemists at monsanto developed the monsanto process for making acetic acid which until 2000 was the method most widely used to make this important industrial chemical in 1965 monsanto chemists invented astroturf which the company then commercialized in 1968 it became the first company to start mass production of visible light emitting diodes leds using gallium arsenide phosphide this ushered in the era of solid state lights from 1968 to 1970 sales doubled every few months their products discrete leds and seven segment numeric displays became the standards of industry the primary markets then were electronic calculators digital watches and digital clocks monsanto was a pioneer of optoelectronics in the 1970s between 1968 and 1974 the company assumed title sponsorship of the pga tour event in pensacola fla that was renamed the pensacola open monsanto

000 prize given to a member of the american society of safety engineers to encourage accident prevention the era of genetically modified crops 1980s monsanto scientists became the first to genetic modification genetically modify a plant cell in 1982 five years later monsanto conducted the first field tests of genetically engineered crops in 1985 monsanto acquired g d searle company a life sciences company focusing on pharmaceuticals agriculture and animal health in 1993 monsanto s searle division filed a patent application for celecoxib celebrex which in 1998 became the first selective cox 2 inhibitor cox 2 inhibitor to be approved by the u s food and drug administration fda celebrex became a blockbuster drug and was often mentioned as a key reason for pfizer s acquisition of monsanto s pharmaceutical business in 2002 in 1994 monsanto introduced a recombinant dna recombinant version of bovine somatotropin brand named posilac monsanto later sold this business off to eli lilly and company in 1996 monsanto purchased agracetus the biotechnology company that had generated the first transgenic varieties of cotton soybeans peanuts and other crops and from which monsanto had already been licencing technology since 1991 monsanto first entered the maize seed business when it purchased 40 of dekalb genetics corporation dekalb in 1996 it purchased the remainder of the

leading global vegetable and fruit seed company for 1 4 billion this made it the world s largest conventional seed company at the time twenty first century largest seed company early 2000 in 2007 monsanto and basf announced a long term agreement to cooperate in the research development and marketing of new plant biotechnology products in october 2008 the company s canadian division monsanto canada inc was named one of canada s top 100 employers by mediacorp canada inc and was featured in maclean s news magazine in january 2010 forbes magazine named monsanto company of the year for 2009 also in 2010 swiss research firm covalence released its annual ranking of the public perceptions of the ethical performance of 581 multinational corporations as rated by the tone and frequency of news articles monsanto company was ranked at the bottom of the list of evaluated companies spin offs and mergers through a series of transactions the monsanto that existed from 1901 to 2000 and the current monsanto are legally two distinct corporations although they share the same name and corporate headquarters many of the same executives and other employees and responsibility for liabilities arising out of activities in the industrial chemical business the agricultural chemicals business is the only segment carried forward from the pre 1997 monsanto company to the current monsanto company this was accomplished beginning in the 1980s 1985 monsanto purchased g d searle company for 2 7 billion in cash in this merger searle s aspartame business became a separate monsanto subsidiary the

seed business by acquiring holden s monsanto became the biggest american producer of foundation corn the parent seed from which hybrids are made the combined purchase price was 925 million also in april monsanto purchased the remaining shares of calgene 1999 monsanto sold off nutrasweet co and two other companies in december monsanto merged with pharmacia pharmacia upjohn and the agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new pharmacia the medical research divisions of monsanto which included products such as celecoxib celebrex were rolled into pharmacia 2000 october pharmacia spun off its monsanto subsidiary into a new company the new monsanto as part of the deal monsanto agreed to indemnify pharmacia against any liabilities that might be incurred from judgments against solutia as a result the new monsanto continues to be a party to numerous lawsuits that relate to operations of the old monsanto pharmacia was bought by pfizer in a deal announced in 2002 and completed in 2003 2005 monsanto acquired emergent genetics and its stoneville and nexgen cotton brands emergent was the third largest u s cotton seed company with about 12 percent of the u s market monsanto s goal was to obtain a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform the vegetable seed producer seminis was purchased for 1 4 billion 2007 in june monsanto completed its purchase of delta pine land company of mississippi delta pine land company a major cotton seed breeder for 1 5 billion as a condition for approval of the purchase from the u s department of justice department of

technology networks robert j stevens executive chairman of the board of lockheed martin corporation products and associated issues current products glyphosate herbicides monsanto chemist john e franz invented glyphosate in 1970 monsanto is the largest producer of glyphosate herbicides in the united states through its roundup herbicide roundup product line which is used to kill weeds especially annual broadleaf weeds and grasses that compete with commercial crops monsanto s last commercially relevant united states patent on glyphosate expired in 2000 and glyphosate is now produced by many companies in the us and around the world as of 2009 sales of roundup herbicides represent about 10 of monsanto s yearly revenue in 2007 glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the us agricultural sector with 180 to 185 million pounds applied and the 2nd most used in home and garden market where users applied 5 to 8 million pounds additionally industry commerce and government applied 13 to 15 million pounds while glyphosate has been approved by regulatory bodies worldwide and is less toxic than all the herbicides it replaced concerns about its effects on humans and the environment persist seeds as of 2012 monsanto s line of seed products includes agricultural seeds and vegetable seeds many of monsanto s agricultural seed products are genetically modified for resistance to herbicides such as glyphosate monsanto sells glyphosate under the brand roundup monsanto calls these seeds roundup ready monsanto s introduction of this system planting glyphosate resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged provided farmers with an opportunity to dramatically increase the yield from a given plot of land since this allowed them to plant rows closer together without it farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to control post emergent weeds with mechanical tillage as of 2009 the overall roundup line of products including the gm seeds represented about 50 of monsanto s business the patent on the first type of roundup ready crop that monsanto produced soybeans expires in 2014 monsanto has broadly licensed the patent to other seed companies that include the glyphosate resistance trait in their seed products about 150 companies have licensed the technology including syngenta and dupont pioneer in addition monsanto invented and sells agricultural seeds that are genetically modified to make a crystalline insecticidal protein from bacillus thuringiensis known as bt in 1995 monsanto s potato plants producing bt toxin were approved for sale by the environmental protection agency after having approved by the u s fda making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the united states monsanto has subsequently developed transgenic maize bt corn bt maize mon 802 mon 809 mon 863 mon 810 genetically modified soybean bt soybean and bt cotton monsanto also produces seed that has multiple modifications also known as stacked traits for instance cotton that make one or more bt proteins and is resistant to glyphosate one of these created in collaboration with dow chemical company is called smartstax in 2011 monsanto launched the genuity brand for its stacked trait products as of 2012 the agricultural seed lineup included roundup ready alfalfa roundup ready canola cotton with bt roundup ready or both traits sorghum hybrids soybeans with various oil profiles most with the roundup ready trait roundup ready sugarbeet and a wide range of wheat products many of which incorporate the nontransgenic clearfield imazamox tolerant trait from basf two patents have been especially important to monsanto s gm soybean business one expired in 2011 and another reissued patent expires in 2014 the expiration of the second patent will mean that glyphosate resistant soybeans will be generic which has generated a great deal of discussion in the soybean industry in 2012 monsanto was the world s largest supplier of vegetable seeds by value selling 800m of seed 95 of the research and development for vegetable seed is in conventional breeding and the company is concentrating on improving the taste of several vegetables former products polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs until it stopped production in 1977 monsanto was the source of 99 of the polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs used by u s industry pcbs are a persistent organic pollutant and cause cancer in animals and likely in humans as well among other health effects pcbs were initially widely welcomed due to the electrical industry s need for durable safer than flammable mineral oil cooling and insulating fluid for industrial transformers and capacitors pcbs were also commonly used as stabilizing additives in the manufacture of flexible pvc coatings for electrical wiring and in electronic components to enhance the heat and fire resistance of the pvc they were known to be highly toxic from the beginning but it was assumed that they would be contained in the products in which they were used however as leaks of transformers occurred and toxicity problems arose near factories their durability and toxicity became widely recognized as serious problems pcb production was banned by the u s congress in 1979 and by the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants in 2001 united states in the late 1960s the monsanto plant in sauget il was the nation s largest producer of pcbs which remain in the water along dead creek in sauget an epa official referred to sauget as one of the most polluted communities in the region and a soup of different chemicals agent orange was manufactured for the u s department of defense primarily by monsanto corporation and dow chemical it was given its name from the color of the orange striped drum container barrels in which it was shipped and was by far the most widely used of the so called rainbow herbicides in 2002 the washington post carried a front page report on monsanto s legacy of environmental damage in anniston alabama related to its legal production of pcbs plaintiffs in a lawsuit pending at that time provided documentation showing that the local monsanto factory knowingly discharged both mercury element mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl pcb laden waste into local creeks for over 40 years in another story published in 2002 the new york times reported that during 1969 alone monsanto had dumped 45 tons of pcbs into snow creek a feeder for choccolocco creek which supplies much of the area s drinking water and that the company buried millions of pounds of pcb in open pit landfills located on hillsides above the plant and surrounding neighborhoods in august 2003 solutia and monsanto agreed to pay plaintiffs 700 million to settle claims by over 20 000 anniston residents related to pcb contamination as of 2012 monsanto is associated with 11 active superfund sites and 20 archived sites in the us in the epa s superfund database monsanto has been sued and has settled multiple times for damaging the health of its employees or residents near its superfund sites through pollution and poisoning united kingdom a uk government report showed that 67 chemicals including agent orange derivatives dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs exclusively made by monsanto are leaking from the brofiscin quarry groes faen brofiscin quarry near groesfaen in wales an unlined porous quarry that was not authorized to take chemical wastes it emerged that the groundwater had been polluted since the 1970s the government was criticised for failing to publish information about the scale and exact nature of this contamination the uk environment agency estimated that it would cost 100m to environmental remediation clean up the site called one of the most contaminated in the uk rbgh recombinant bovine growth hormone monsanto developed and sold recombinant dna recombinant bovine somatotropin also known as bovine somatotropin rbst and rbgh a synthetic hormone that increases milk production by 11 16 when injected into cows in october 2008 monsanto sold this business in full to eli lilly and company eli lilly for a price of 300 million plus additional consideration the use of rbst has been controversial with respect to its effects on cows to which it is administered and with respect to the milk produced by those cows in some markets milk from cows that are not treated with rbst is sold with labels indicating it is rbst free this milk has proved popular with consumers in reaction to this in early 2008 a pro rbst advocacy group called american farmers for the advancement and conservation of technology afact made up of dairies and originally affiliated with monsanto formed and began lobbying to ban such labels afact stated that absence labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with rbst is inferior pipeline products along with other ag biotech companies monsanto has been working on developing drought resistant gm crops as of 2013 monsanto s new product line the xtend crop system was undergoing regulatory review the system includes seed genetically modified to be resistant to glyphoase and dicamba and an herbicide product including those two active ingredients pipeline products cancelled terminator seeds genetic use restriction technology colloquially known as terminator technology produces plants that have sterile seeds if put into use it would prevent the spread of those seeds into the wild it also would prevent farmers from planting seeds they harvest requiring them to repurchase seed for every planting although they also need to do this for hybrid seeds because second generation seeds are inferior and in cases of patented transgenic seeds where patent holders like monsanto enter into contracts with farmers who agree not to plant harvested seeds as a condition of purchase terminator technology has been developed by governmental labs university researchers and companies sometimes in collaboration and sometimes independently the technology has never been known to have been used commercially rumors that monsanto and other companies intended to introduce terminator technology have caused protests for example in india in 1999 monsanto pledged not to commercialize terminator technology and has displayed that pledge on its website to the present day the delta and pine land company intended to commercialize the technology animal genetics in the 2000s monsanto entered into the pig breeding business via a subsidiary monsanto choice genetics it exited the business in 2009 when it sold that business to newsham genetics lc in november divesting itself of any and all swine related patents patent applications and all other intellectual property and syngenta patents filings in 2003 monsanto filed patent applications with claims on breeding techniques for pigs greenpeace claimed that monsanto was trying to claim ownership on ordinary breeding techniques and the filings became the target for demonstrations in germany a uk news article indicated that the practices it monsanto wants to protect involve identifying genes that result in desirable traits breeding pigs to achieve those traits and using a specialised device to inseminate sows deeply in a way that uses less sperm than is typically required in europe the european patent office rejected some claims as relating to an essentially biological process excluded from patent protection but an application with claims from this set of filings was granted in 2008 and was later revoked in 2007 monsanto sold monsanto choice genetics the monsanto entity driving these patent filings to newsham genetics lc of west des moines iowa the transaction was completed in november 2007 and monsanto is no longer in the swine breeding business nor interested in patent filings on pigs or pig breeding the center for food safety has listed 90 lawsuits through 2004 by monsanto against farmers for claims of seed patent violations the usual claim involves violation of a technology agreement that prohibits farmers from saving seed from one season s crop to plant the next one farmer received an eight month prison sentence for conspiracy to commit fraud during litigation with monsanto in addition to having to pay damages monsanto defends its patents and their use explaining that patents are necessary to ensure that it is paid for its products and for all the investments it puts into developing products the principle behind a farmer s seed contract is simple a business must be paid for its product monsanto states that a very small percentage of farmers do not honor this agreement while most lawsuits involve breach of monsanto s technology agreement farmers who have not signed this type of contract but do use the patented seed can also be found liable for violating monsanto s patent notably in one case where a farmer was found to be willfully infringing monsanto s patent the damages awarded to monsanto were found to be non dischargeable in the farmer s chapter 7 bankruptcy as they fell within the bankruptcy act s exception for willful and malicious injuries monsanto sued the pilot grove cooperative elevator in pilot grove missouri on the grounds that by cleaning harvested seeds covered by monsanto s patents so that farmers could replant them the elevator was patent infringement under united states law indirect infringement inducing them to infringe monsanto s patents the pilot grove cooperative elevator had been cleaning conventional seeds for decades before the development of genetic engineering and developments in patent law led to the existence of issued patents that cover seeds in a related and more publicized case a seed cleaner from indiana maurice parr was sued by monsanto for inducing farmers to save seeds in violation of monsanto s patent rights parr told his customers that cleaning patented seeds for replanting was not infringing activity the case was settled and in exchange for paying no monetary damages parr agreed to an injunction requiring parr to obtain certification from his clients that their seeds were not monsanto patented seeds and to advise clients that seed saving of patented seeds is illegal mr parr was featured in a documentary food inc in one case in 2002 monsanto mistakenly sued gary rinehart of eagleville missouri for patent violation rinehart was not a farmer or seed dealer but sharecropped land with his brother and nephew who were violating the patent monsanto dropped the lawsuit against him when it discovered the mistake monsanto had been investigating farmers in rinehart s small farm community 100 miles north of kansas city after monsanto realized they had the wrong person and dropped the suit it did not apologize for the mistake or offer to pay rinehart s attorney fees schmeiser appealed and lost again schmeiser appealed to the supreme court of canada supreme court which took the case and held for monsanto by a 5 4 vote in late may 2004 with this ruling the canadian courts followed the u s supreme court in its decision on patent issues involving plants and genes schmeiser won a partial victory as the supreme court reversed on damages finding that because schmeiser did not gain any profit from the infringement he did not owe monsanto any damages nor did he have to pay monsanto s substantial legal bills the case caused monsanto s enforcement tactics to be highlighted in the media over the years it took to play out the case is widely cited or referenced by the anti gm community in the context of a fear of a company claiming ownership of a farmer s crop based on the inadvertent presence of gm pollen grain or seed the court record shows however that it was not just a few seeds from a passing truck but that mr schmeiser was growing a crop of 95 98 pure roundup ready plants a commercial level of purity far higher than one would expect from inadvertent or accidental presence the judge could not account for how a few wayward seeds or pollen grains could come to dominate hundreds of acres without mr schmeiser s active participation saying none of the suggested sources could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of roundup ready canola of a commercial quality evident from the results of tests on schmeiser s crop in other words the original presence of monsanto seed on his land in 1997 was indeed inadvertent but the crop in 1998 was entirely purposeful in 2007 monsanto sued indiana farmer vernon hugh bowman who in 1999 bought seed for his second planting from a grain elevator the same elevator that he and others sold their transgenic crops the case was later known as bowman v monsanto co the elevator sold the soybeans as commodities not as seeds for planting he tested the new seeds and found that as he had expected some were resistant to glyphosate he replanted his harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator then unanimously affirmed the federal circuit on may 13 2013 in 2009 monsanto sued dupont pioneer for patent infringement of roundup ready patents dupont had licensed the patents from monsanto already but had added additional glyphosphate resistance genes to its seed which monsanto claimed was not allowed in the license dupont counter sued claiming that monsanto s patent was invalid the jury handed down a verdict on august 1 2012 finding that dupont not only infringed but willfully infringed and awarded a verdict of 1 billion the fourth largest patent verdict in the history of the united states dupont indicated it would appeal the decision in another victory against an individual farmer in 2003 monsanto suspected that loren david had saved soybean from his previous year s harvest in violation of their technology agreement in 2004 monsanto obtained samples from the soybean that david had harvested and sold on the basis of the test results monsanto sued for patent infringement breach of contract unjust enrichment and conversion the court found that david s testimony was not reliable and in 2006 the court held that david had willfully infringed the patent and breached the technology agreement he signed with monsanto by planting seed from a prior year s crop ultimately the court held david liable to pay 786 989 43 to monsanto on appeal david unpersuasively argued that there was no reliable evidence of patent infringement david also challenged the damage award for attorney fees and cost awards as well as the reasonable royalty on the soy the court found that monsanto s attorney fees in their contract were not limited by statute but that the royalty calculated on a planting density for david s soy was erroneous the court affirmed the judgment but vacated the seed density amount and remand for the district court to determine the rate as defendant in 2006 the public patent foundation filed requests with the united states patent and trademark office to revoke four patents that monsanto has used in patent lawsuits against farmers namely u s patents nos 5 164 316 5 196 525 5 322 938 and 5 352 605 in the first round of reexamination some claims in all four patents were rejected by the patent office in four separate rulings dating from february through july 2007 on march 30 2011 the public patent foundation filed claims in federal u s district court in manhattan challenging the validity of 23 of monsanto s patents on genetically modified seed on behalf of the organic seed growers and trade association and 82 other farming associations the group contended that they were being forced to sue pre emptively to protect themselves from being accused of patent infringement should their fields ever become contaminated by monsanto s genetically modified seed on february 24 district court judge naomi buchwald dismissed the lawsuit and in her ruling criticized the plaintiffs for a transparent effort to create a controversy where none exists plaintiffs planned to appeal the decision and did so in june 2013 the federal circuit affirmed the district court decision in february 2012 two ngos navdanya and no patent on seeds filed documents opposing an eu patent awarded to monsanto covering virus resistant traits of melons they were joined by bayer cropscience the activists claim it was not an invention of monsanto but rather commercialization of indigenous knowledge bio piracy because the virus resistant plants originated in india and were registered in international seed banks they further claimed that conventional breeding methods were used to transfer the virus resistance genes from an indian melon to other melons and that european law prohibits patents on conventional breeding other legal actions in north america as defendant in a case that ran from february 1984 through october 1987 monsanto was the defendant in the longest civil jury trial in u s history kemner v monsanto the case involved a group of plaintiffs who claimed to have been poisoned by dioxin in 1979 when a train derailed in sturgeon missouri tank cars on the train carried a chemical used to make wood preservatives and small quantities of a dioxin called 2 3 7 8 tcdd formed as a part of the manufacturing process the initial outcome was mixed the jurors after deliberating more than two months agreed with monsanto that the plaintiffs had suffered no physical harm from exposure to dioxin but they accepted the plaintiffs argument that monsanto had failed to alter its manufacturing process to eliminate dioxin as a byproduct and that it had failed to warn the public about dioxin s harmfulness most of the plaintiffs were awarded only one dollar each for actual losses but they were awarded 16 2 million in punitive damages monsanto appealed the judgments and won on all counts monsanto and its customers such as westinghouse and ge also faced litigation from third parties such as workers at scrapyards that bought used electrical equipment and broke them down to reclaim valuable metals monsanto settled some of these cases and won the others on the grounds that it had clearly told its customers that pcbs were dangerous chemicals and that protective procedures needed to be implemented in 2000 great lakes chemical corporation glc sued monsanto for the 71 million shortfall in expected sales in 1999 monsanto had sold glc a business unit nsc technologies for approximately 125 million in cash nsc technologies developed manufactured and sold chiral pharmaceutical intermediates and select bulk actives to pharmaceutical companies including the key ingredient of aspartame when sales did not meet projections glc sued monsanto under federal securities laws the federal case was dismissed glc then sued monsanto under delaware state law the outcome of this case is not known in 2003 monsanto reached a 300 million settlement with people in alabama affected by the manufacturing and dumping of the toxic chemical polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in 2004 monsanto along with dow chemical company dow and other chemical companies were sued in a us court by agent orange vietnamese victims class action lawsuit in u s courts a group of vietnamese for the effects of its agent orange defoliant used by the us military in the vietnam war the case was dismissed and plaintiffs appealed all the way to the supreme court which also denied the appeal in 2004 the world s largest agrichemical company switzerland s syngenta launched a us lawsuit charging monsanto with using coercive tactics to monopolize markets a flurry of litigation ensued all of which was settled in 2008 in 2005 the united states department of justice us doj filed a deferred prosecution agreement in which monsanto admitted to violations of the foreign corrupt practices act 15 u s c 78dd 1 and making false entries into its books and records 15 u s c 78m b 2 5 monsanto also agreed to pay a 1 5m fine the case involved bribes paid to an indonesian official monsanto admitted a senior manager at monsanto directed an indonesian consulting firm to give a 50 000 bribe to a high level official in indonesia s environment ministry in 2002 related to the agency s assessment on its genetically modified cotton monsanto told the company to disguise an invoice for the bribe as consulting fees monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high ranking indonesian officials between 1997 and 2002 on march 5 2008 the deferred prosecution agreement against monsanto was dismissed with prejudice unopposed by the department of justice by the u s district court for the district of columbia thereby indicating that monsanto had complied fully with the terms of the agreement in late 2006 the correctional tribunal of carcassonne france ordered two directors of monsanto subsidiary asgrow to pay a 15 000 fine related to their knowledge of the presence of unauthorized genetically modified organisms gmos in bags of seeds imported by asgrow on april 13 2000 monsanto was the subject of an investigation by the environmental agency of the uk regarding pollution caused by disposal of pcbs and other toxic waste at brofiscin quarry groes faen in february 2011 the guardian reported that monsanto had agreed to help with the costs of remediation but did not accept responsibility for the pollution a webpage at the environmental agency site put up at around that time states we have completed our extensive enquiries to identify those we consider should be held responsible under the contaminated land laws and be held liable for the cost of remediating brofiscin quarry we are at an advanced stage in our consultations with bp veolia and monsanto to provide them with the opportunity to help remediate the land on a voluntary basis we expect to make further progress on this matter in the next few months if this approach is unsuccessful we have the power to carry out the work needed ourselves and recover our costs the three companies have been identified under the legislation as inheriting the liabilities of companies who were associated with depositing wastes at the quarry in may 2013 glyphosate resistant genetically modified wheat wheat a gmo that was not yet approved for release was discovered in a farm in oregon growing as a weed or volunteer plant the wheat was developed by monsanto and was a strain that was field tested from 1998 to 2005 and was in the regulatory approval process before monsanto withdrew it based on concern that importers would avoid the crop the last field test in oregon occurred in 2001 as of may 2013 there was no information as to how the wheat got there or whether it had entered the food supply volunteer wheat from a former test field two miles away was tested and it was not found to be glyphosate resistant monsanto faced penalties up to 1 million if violations of the plant protection act would be found the discovery threatened us wheat exports which totaled 8 1 billion in 2012 the us is the world s largest wheat exporter new scientist reported that the variety of wheat was rarely imported into europe and doubted that the discovery of the wheat would affect europe but more likely destined for asia according to monsanto it destroyed all the material it held after completing trials in 2004 and it was mystified by its appearance on june 14 2013 the usda announced as of today usda has neither found nor been informed of anything that would indicate that this incident amounts to more than a single isolated incident in a single field on a single farm all information collected so far shows no indication of the presence of ge wheat in commerce as of august 30 2013 while the source of the gm wheat remained unknown japan south korea and taiwan had all resumed placing orders and the disruption of the export market was minimal as plaintiff or appellant in 2003 monsanto sued oakhurst dairy over oakhurst s label on its milk cartons that said our farmer s pledge no artificial hormones referring to the use of bovine somatotropin rbst the two companies settled out of court and it was announced that oakhurst would add the word used at the end of its label and note that the u s fda claims there is no major difference between milk from rbst treated and non rbst treated cows in 2010 the supreme court of the united states u s supreme court ruled in case known as monsanto co v geertson seed farms the case concerned an injunction against the planting of monsanto s gentically engineered roundup herbicide roundup ready alfalfa rra in 2005 the united states department of agriculture s animal and plant health inspection service aphis had deregulated rra based on an environmental impact assessment environmental assessment ea of monsanto s rra in 2006 geertson seed farm and others filed suit in united states district court for the northern district of california a california district court against the aphis deregulation of rra the district court disallowed aphis deregulation of rra and issued an injunction against any new planting of rra pending the preparation of a much more extensive environmental impact statement eis the court also refused to allow a partial deregulation then appealed to the u s supreme court in 2010 the supreme court reversed the district court s decision they stated that before a court disallows a partial deregulation a plaintiff must show that it has suffered irreparable injury the district court abused its discretion in enjoining aphis from effecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of rra pending the agency s completion of its detailed environmental review this was the first ruling of the united states supreme court on genetically engineered crops after aphis prepared an environmental impact statement for rra in 2012 it was deregulated again on january 23 2008 the center for food safety the sierra club and the organic seed alliance and high mowing seeds filed a lawsuit against usda aphis regarding their decision to deregulate a glyphosate resistant sugar beet developed by monsanto and kws saat ag in 2005 the organizations expressed concerns regarding glyphosate resistant sugar beets ability to potentially cross pollinate with conventional sugar beet on september 21 2009 u s district judge jeffrey s white united states district court for the northern district of california u s district court for the northern district of california ruled that usda aphis had violated federal law in deregulating glyphosate resistant sugar beet in november 2010 in response to a suit by the original parties judge white ordered the destruction of the plantings in february 2011 a federal appeals court for the northern district of california in san francisco citing the supreme court s 2010 decision on rra overturned the ruling concluding that the plaintiffs have failed to show a likelihood of irreparable injury biology geography field experience and permit restrictions make irreparable injury unlikely aphis developed requirements that growers had to follow if handling glyphosate resistant sugar beet while it was regulated in july 2012 after completing an environmental impact assessment and a plant pest risk assessment the usda deregulated monsanto s roundup ready sugar beets again investigations 2009 antitrust investigation in 2009 monsanto came under scrutiny from the u s department of justice which began investigating whether the company s activities in the soybean markets were breaking anti trust rules in 2010 the department of justice created a website through which comments on agriculture and antitrust enforcement issues in our 21st century economy could be submitted over 15 000 comments were submitted including a letter by 14 state attorneys general the comments are publicly available on november 16 2012 monsanto announced that it had received written notification from the u s department of justice that the antitrust division had concluded its inquiry and that the department of justice had closed the inquiry without taking any enforcement action opponents of monsanto s seed patenting and licensing practices expressed frustration that the department of justice released no information about the results of the inquiry not a party but involved 1997 wtvt news story this is a case where monsanto was not a party but was alleged to have been involved in the events under dispute in 1997 the news division of wtvt channel 13 a fox broadcasting company fox fox television stations group owned station in tampa florida planned to air an investigative report by steve wilson reporter steve wilson and jane akre on the health risks allegedly associated with monsanto s bovine somatotropin bovine growth hormone product posilac just before the story was to air fox received a threatening letter from monsanto saying the reporters were biased and that the story would damage the company the appeals court overturned the verdict finding that akre was not a whistleblower because of the florida legislature s requirement that agency statements that fit the definition of a rule must be formally adopted rules recognizing an uncodified agency policy developed through the adjudicative process as the equivalent of a formally adopted rule is not consistent with this policy and it would expand the scope of conduct that could subject an employer to liability beyond what florida s legislature could have contemplated when it enacted the whistle blower s statute industrial bio test laboratories scandal in 1981 four executives of industrial bio test laboratories ibt an american contract research organization were indicted in federal court on various counts including scientific misconduct and fraud and were convicted in 1983 ibt was an industrial product safety testing laboratory that was used by pharmaceutical companies chemical manufacturers and other industrial clients operated one of the largest facility of its kind in the us and performed more than one third of all toxicology testing in the united states one of convicted executives was paul wright a toxicologist who had spent 18 months at ibt in the 1970s while ibt was testing an antimicrobial product that monsanto was developing triclocarban tcc the revelations of misconduct by ibt labs led to the establishment of good laboratory practice standards and regulations for industrial testing in 1991 philip smith a former assistant toxicologist at ibt testified in a trial in which monsanto was being sued by workers at westinghouse over pcbs that final toxicology reports on pcbs provided to monsanto by ibt contained falsified data legal actions and controversies outside north america argentina gm soy was approved for cultivation in argentina in 1996 when argentina approved the cultivation of gmo in 1996 14 million acres were used for soy production and by 2008 that area grew to 42 million acres the growth was driven by argentine investors interest in buying or leasing land on which to grow soy for the export market the guardian newspaper interviewed a monsanto representative and reported that the representative said that any problems with gm soya were to do with use of the crop as a monoculture not because it was gm if you grow any crop to the exclusion of any other you are bound to get problems in 2013 tensions arose between environmentalist groups on one side and monsanto and the government of c rdoba argentina c rdoba on the other the company with the local authorities consent is building a corn seed conditioning facility in malvinas argentinas c rdoba and neighbours have denounced the risk of environmental impact despite court rulings which have decided the enterprise could continue to build the facilities environmentalist groups have organised demonstrations and have opened an online petition for the subject to be decided on a popular referendum nevertheless the court rulings have also stipulated that while construction can continue the facility could not begin operating until the environmental impact report required by law is dutifully presented brazil brazil had originally approved gm crops in 1998 but brazilian advocacy groups had successfully sued to overturn the approval in 2003 brazil allowed a one year exemption when gm soy was found in fields planted in the state of rio grande do sul in 2005 brazil passed a law creating a regulatory pathway for gm crops and the agriculture minister roberto rodrigues stated that brazilian soy farmers who have used cloned or smuggled versions of the biotechnology company s roundup ready variety for years will no longer have to worry about breaking the law or facing legal action from monsanto as long as regulators approve the seeds for planting china monsanto was criticized by chinese economist larry hsien ping lang larry lang for having controlled the chinese soybean market and for trying to do the same to chinese corn and cotton haiti after the 2010 haiti earthquake monsanto donated 255 000 to haiti for disaster relief and 60 000 seed sacks 475 tons of hybrid non gm corn and vegetable seeds worth 4 million however a catholic relief services crs rapid assessment of seed supply and demand for the 5 most common food security crops found that the haitians had enough seed and recommended that imported seeds should be introduced only on a small scale the announcement of the donation initially raised concerns that the donation would include genetically modified seeds but monsanto representatives said no such seeds were included and the donation comprised conventional seed and hybrid seeds which are produced by manually cross pollinating plants emmanuel prophete head of haiti s ministry of agriculture s service national semencier sns told hgw that sns was not opposed to the hybrid maize seeds because it at least doubles the yield of corn louise sperling principal researcher at the international center for tropical agriculture ciat told hgw that she was not opposed to hybrids but noted that most hybrids require extra water and better soils and that most of haiti was not appropriate for maize hybrids another concern was that some of the seeds were coated with the highly toxic fungicides maxim or thiram in the united states pesticides containing thiram are banned in home garden products because most home gardeners do not own adequate protection hgw found that the coated seeds were handled in a dangerous manner by the recipients and judged that such seeds should not have been donated india monsanto has had a controversial history in india starting with the accusation that monsanto used terminator technology terminator genes in its seeds causing demonstrations against the company later its gm cotton seed was the subject of ngo agitation because of its higher cost indian farmers cross gm varieties with local varieties using plant breeding to yield better strains an illegal practice termed seed piracy in 2009 high prices of bt cotton were blamed for forcing farmers of the district jhabua into severe debts when the crops died due to lack of rain bt resistance in 2009 monsanto scientists initially discovered that insects had developed resistance to the bt cotton bt cotton planted in gujarat and when studies were completed monsanto communicated this to the indian government and its customers stating that resistance is natural and expected so measures to delay resistance are important among the factors that may have contributed to pink bollworm resistance to the cry1ac protein in bollgard i in gujarat are limited refuge planting and early use of unapproved bt cotton seed planted prior to geac approval of bollgard i cotton which may have had lower protein expression levels the company advised farmers to switch to its second generation of bt cotton bolguard ii which had two resistance genes instead of one however this advice was criticized an article in the hindu reported that an internal analysis of the statement of the ministry of environment and forests says it appears that this could be a business strategy to phase out single gene events that is the first generation bollgard i product and promote double genes the second generation bollgard ii which would fetch higher price andhra pradesh state government in the early 2000s farmers in the state of andhra pradesh were in economic crisis due to high interest rates and crop failures leading to widespread social unrest and suicides monsanto was one focus of protests with respect to the price of bt seed and yields of bt seed in 2005 the genetic engineering approval committee the indian regulatory authority released a study on field tests of certain bt cotton strains in andhra pradesh and ruled that monsanto could not market those strains in andhra pradesh because the yields were poor and extended the ban on one of them mech 12 bt to all of south india at about the same time the state agriculture minister barred the company from selling any bt cotton seeds in the state because monsanto refused a request by the state government to provide a compensation package of about rs 4 5 crore about 1 million us to indebted farmers in some districts and because the government blamed monsanto s bt seeds for crop failures the order was later lifted in 2006 the andhra pradesh state government tried to convince monsanto to reduce the price at which it sold bt seeds when monsanto did not reduce the price enough to satisfy the government the state filed several cases against monsanto and its mumbai based licensee maharashtra hybrid seeds research by ifpri found that there was no substantial increase in suicides and that bt cotton was effective in india child labor as in much of the developing world and especially in agricultural areas child labor is widespread in india s agricultural sector which employs 60 of child labour in india india s child labor child labor is especially used in seed production the seed production is done mostly through child labor it is carried out on plots owned by small farmers who sell the seed to seed organizers who in turn sell the seed to public and private seed agencies and companies farmer suicides in the late 1990s and early 2000s public attention was drawn to suicides by indebted farmers in india following crop failures critics including vandana shiva said that the crop failures could often be traced to monsanto s bt cotton and that the seeds increased farmers indebtedness and argued that monsanto misrepresented the profitability of their genetically modified cotton bt cotton causing farmers to suffer losses leading to debt in 2009 dr shiva wrote that indian farmers who had previously spent as little as 7 rupees per kilogram were now paying up to rs 17 000 per kilo per year after switching to bt cotton more recently in 2012 the indian council of agricultural research icar and the central cotton research institute ccri stated that for the first time farmer suicides could be linked to a decline in the performance of bt cotton and they issued an advisory stating that cotton farmers are in a deep crisis since shifting to bt cotton the spate of farmer suicides in 2011 12 has been particularly severe among bt cotton farmers the survey cited government apathy the absence of a safety net for farmers and lack of access to information related to agriculture as the chief causes for the desperate condition of farmers in the state the report stated that farmer suicides predate the official commercial introduction of bt cotton by monsanto mahyco in 2002 and its unofficial introduction by navbharat seeds in 2001 and that such suicides were a fairly constant portion of the overall national suicide rate since 1997 the report concluded that while bt cotton may have been a factor in specific suicides the contribution was likely marginal compared to socio economic factors the icar and ccri stated that the cost of cotton cultivation had jumped as a consequence of rising pesticide costs while total bt cotton production in the five years from 2007 to 2012 had declined as of 2009 87 of indian cotton growing land was used for bt cotton false advertising in 1996 the new york times reported that dennis c vacco the attorney general of new york ordered the company to pull ads that said roundup was safer than table salt and practically nontoxic to mammals birds and fish the company withdrew the spots but also said that the phrase in question was permissible under e p a guidelines in 1999 monsanto was condemned by the uk advertising standards authority united kingdom advertising standards authority asa for making confusing misleading unproven and wrong claims about its products over the course of a 1 million advertising campaign the asa ruled that monsanto had presented its opinions as accepted fact and had published wrong and unproven scientific claims monsanto responded with an apology and claimed it was not intending to deceive and instead did not take sufficiently into account the difference in culture between the uk and the usa in the way some of this information was presented in 2001 french environmental and consumer rights campaigners brought a case against monsanto for misleading the public about the environmental impact assessment environmental impact of its herbicide roundup herbicide roundup on the basis that glyphosate roundup s main ingredient is classed as dangerous for the environment and toxic for aquatic organisms by the european union monsanto s advertising for roundup had presented it as biodegradable and as leaving the soil clean after use in 2007 monsanto was convicted of false advertising and was fined 15 000 euros monsanto s french distributor scotts france was also fined 15 000 euros both defendants were ordered to pay damages of 5 000 euros to the brittany water and rivers association and 3 000 euros to the clcv consommation logement cadre de vie one of the two main general consumer associations in france monsanto appealed and the court upheld the verdict monsanto appealed again to the french supreme court and in 2009 it also upheld the verdict in august 2012 a brazilian regional federal court ordered monsanto to pay a 250 000 fine for false advertising in 2004 advertising that related to the use of gm soya seed and the herbicide glyphosate used in its cultivation claimed it was beneficial to the conservation of the environment the federal prosecutor maintained that monsanto misrepresented the amount of herbicide required and stated that there is no scientific certainty that soybeans marketed by monsanto use less herbicide the presiding judge condemned monsanto and called the advertisement abusive and misleading propaganda the prosecutor held that the goal of the advertising was to prepare the market for the purchase of genetically modified soybean seed sale of which was then banned and the herbicide used on it at a time when the approval of a brazilian biosafety law enacted in 2005 was being discussed in the country march against monsanto protests a worldwide protest against monsanto and gmos took place on may 25 2013 the number of protesters who took part is uncertain figures of hundreds of thousands or two million were variously cited according to organizers protesters in 436 cities and 52 countries took part political contributions and lobbying united states monsanto lobbying in the united states lobbies the united states congress and the u s department of agriculture about regulations that would affect the production and distribution of genetically engineered produce in 2011 monsanto spent about 6 3 million in comparison the 20th highest spender pfizer spent 12 9 million us diplomats in europe have worked directly for monsanto in 2011 total money spent on lobbying was about 6 3 million more than any other agribusiness firm except the tobacco company altria monsanto spent 8 1 million opposing the passage of proposition 37 proposition 37 proposition 37 in the us state of california making it the largest donor against the initiative proposition 37 which was rejected by a 53 7 majority in november 2012 would have mandated the genetically modified food controversies labeling disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of california food products biotechnology labeling is not required by the united states food and drug administration fda but it has been adopted by over 40 countries according to public disclosures the council for biotechnology information and the grocery manufacturers association have each made matching donations of 375 000 to fight the initiative michael r taylor a former monsanto vice president for public policy and the current senior advisor to the commissioner united states commissioner of the us food and drug administration was described by businessweek during his tenure as monsanto s vp for public policy as monsanto s chief rep in washington monsanto is a member of the washington d c based biotechnology industry organization bio the world s largest biotechnology trade association which provides advocacy business development and communications services between 2010 and 2011 bio spent a total of 16 43 million on lobbying initiatives the farmer assurance provision known as monsanto protection act by critics was part of a bill to provide consolidated and further continuing appropriations act 2013 continued funding to the federal government in the ongoing us budget stalemate and was signed into law by president barack obama on march 26 2013 it expires at the end of the federal fiscal year on september 20 2013 it was originally included as section 733 in the june 2012 initial draft of the fy2013 agriculture appropriations bill the bill s sole dissenter senator john tester d mt proposed an amendment to remove it from the bill but it never went to a vote opponents described it as hidden backroom deal and after it passed the senate more than 250 000 petitioners signed a petition for president obama to veto the bill on the premise that it effectively bars federal courts from being able to halt the sale or planting of controversial genetically modified seeds no matter what health issues may arise concerning gmos in the future in september 2013 the controversial provision was removed from the senate version of the bill the monsanto company citizenship fund aka monsanto citizenship fund is a political action committee from monsanto that has donated over 10 million to various candidates since 2003 more recently as of october 2013 monsanto and dupont co are backing an anti labeling campaign with roughly 18 million so far dedicated to the campaign washington along with 26 other states have proposals coming up in november to require labels on genetically modified foods uk during the late 1990s monsanto lobbied to raise permitted glyphosate levels in soya beans and was successful in convincing codex alimentarius and both the uk and american governments to lift levels to 20 milligrams per 1 kilogram of soya when asked how negotiations with monsanto were conducted lord donoughue then the labour party uk labour party agriculture minister in the house of lords stated that all information relating to the matter would be kept secret british newspapers revealed that stanley greenberg an election advisor to tony blair went on to work as a monsanto consultant it was also revealed that peter luff then a conservative party uk conservative party member of parliament united kingdom mp and chairman of the agriculture select committee had received up to 10 000 a year from bell pottinger on behalf of monsanto continental europe in january 2011 john vidal of the guardian reported on wikileak documents that suggested us diplomats in europe were responding to a request for help from spanish government the article says in addition the cables show us diplomats working directly for gm companies such as monsanto in response to recent urgent requests by spanish rural affairs ministry state secretary josep puxeu and monsanto post requests renewed us government support of spain s science based agricultural biotechnology position through high level us government intervention the documents show that in 2009 when the spanish government s policy allowing mon810 corn to be grown as allowed under european law was under pressure from eu interests monsanto s director for biotechnology for spain and portugal requested that the us government support spain on the matter the reports also indicated that spain and the us had worked closely together to persuade the eu not to

experimental oxidation catalyst filtering canister to the diesel engine s exhaust manifold they are attempting to reduce the amount of unburned hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and particulate matter generated much like a catalytic converter in automobiles and trucks the united states environmental protection agency s national vehicle fuels and emissions laboratory provided most of the funding for the test using ultra low sulfur diesel with the oxicat resulted in reduced particulate emissions by approximately 50 nbsp percent unburned hydrocarbons by 38 nbsp percent and carbon monoxide by 82

cross emblem for specific uses were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the united states in 1882 however the emblem was not protected by u s law for the use of the american red cross and the u s military until after johnson johnson had obtained its trademark a clause in this law now 18 u s c 706 permits pre existing uses of the red cross such as johnson johnson s to continue please do not insert any further assertions that continued johnson johnson use of the red cross violates the geneva conventions as the paragraph below states the u s specifically excluded that application of the geneva conventions thru a reservation a declaration made by the u s upon its ratification of the 1949 geneva conventions includes a reservation law reservation that pre 1905 u s domestic uses of the red cross such as johnson johnson s would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on aircraft vessels vehicles buildings or other structures or upon the ground uses which could be confused with its military uses this means that the u s did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 geneva conventions that would overrule johnson johnson s trademark even as it disputes a recent lawsuit by johnson johnson the american red cross continues to recognize the validity of johnson johnson s trademark in august 2007 johnson johnson filed a lawsuit against the american red cross arc demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public though the company takes no issue with the charity s use of the mark for non profit purposes in may 2008 the

its original decision stating because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone then explained its reversal listening to our members we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their netflix experience simplicity is only one

time warner ceo jeffrey bewkes downplayed netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies it s a little bit like is the albanian army going to take over the world bewkes told the newspaper i don t think so at the same time he recognized that the company s dvd service may have contributed to a decline in dvd sales and regarding the industry s willingness to make special deals with netflix in the future he added this has been an era of experimentation and i think it s coming to a close bewkes later refined his position stating during a 2011 conference call that things like netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure they can monetize value for companies like warner that maybe there wasn t in terms of efficiency for older product wasn t as available before our view of netflix has been very consistent i ve tried at times to be humorous about it sometimes to make a point after the contract with viacom that allowed netflix to instantly stream nickelodeon nick jr programs expired netflix received a new contract from time warner that allowed them to instantly stream cartoon network adult swim programs finance and revenue 2010 in 2010 netflix s stock price increased 219 to 175 70 and it added 8 million subscribers bringing its total to 20 nbsp million revenue jumped 29 to 2 16 nbsp billion and net income was up 39 to 161 nbsp million 2011 in april 2011 netflix was expected to earn 1 07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of 705 7 nbsp million a huge increase compared to the year earlier profit of 59 cents on revenue of 493 7 nbsp million according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by factset research at their peak in july 2011 netflix shares were trading for 299 following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by ceo reed hastings that streaming and dvd rental would be charged separately leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both on september 1 and that the dvd rental would be split off as the subsidiary qwikster on september 18 the share price fell steeply to around 130 however on october 10 2011 the ceo announced that the move to split the company would be scrapped the reason being that two websites would make things more difficult he stated on the netflix blog on november 22 netflix s share took a tumble as share prices fell by as much as 7 by december 2011 as a consequence of its decision to raise prices neflix had lost over 75 of its total value from the summer describing their business model as broken wedbush downgraded netflix s stock rating to underperform the equivalent of sell legal issues and controversies recommendation algorithm and the netflix prize in 2006 netflix held the first netflix prize competition to find a better program to predict user preferences and beat its existing netflix movie recommendation system known as cinematch by at least 10 ceo reed hastings didn t necessarily expect a lot of quick progress towards the prize but by june 2007 hastings said the competition is three quarters of the way there in three quarters of a year three teams an at t research team called bellkor commendo s team bigchaos and pragmatic theory combined to win the 2009 grand prize competition for 1 nbsp million the winning team called bellkor s pragmatic chaos used machine learning techniques to find that for example the rating system people use for older movies is very different from that used for a movie they just saw the mood of the day made a difference also for example friday ratings were different from monday morning ratings in 2010 netflix canceled a running contest to improve the company s recommendation algorithm due to privacy concerns under the terms of the competition contestants were given access to customer rental data which the company had purportedly anonymized however it was discovered that even this anonymized dataset could in fact identify a user personally netflix was sued by kamberlaw l l c and ended the contest after reaching a deal with the ftc throttling in september 2004 a consumer class action lawsuit frank chavez v netflix inc was brought against netflix in san francisco superior court the suit alleged false advertising in relation to claims of unlimited rentals with one day delivery in january 2005 netflix changed its terms of use to acknowledge what has commonly become known as online dvd rental throttling throttling mike kaltschnee owner of the hacking netflix blog says netflix calls this practice smoothing internally in october 2005 netflix proposed a settlement for those who had enrolled as a paid netflix member prior to january 15 2005 these earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one month free membership and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one month free upgrade to the next highest membership level netflix s settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing and the case did not reach a legal judgment netflix estimated the settlement cost at approximately us 4 nbsp million which included up to us 2 53 nbsp million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees a controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer s account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement with customers being charged accordingly unless they opted out after the month long free period ended after trial lawyers for public justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement and the federal trade commission filed an amicus curiae amicus brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement netflix offered to alter the settlement terms requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month the final settlement hearing took place on march 22 2006 implementation of the settlement was delayed pending appeal the california appellate courts the settlement was affirmed on april 21 2008 with the court saying the trial court did not abuse its discretion in approving the amended class action settlement agreement approving the notice given to class members or determining the amount of fees interestingly the court approved email notice and an online claims submission process the court said blockquote the summary notice and long form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule in a highly accessible form the fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e mail or mailing is immaterial using a summary notice that directed the class member wanting more information to a web site containing a more detailed notice and provided hyperlinks to that web site was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case the class members conducted business with defendant over the internet and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the summary notice and the web site using the capability of the internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice especially compared to the alternative vogel apparently preferred mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members would have been able to plow through blockquote the settlement was criticized because it paid out 2 5 nbsp million to attorneys for fees and costs while offering only coupons to the class members the terms of use have since been amended with terms that indicate such a suit would not be possible in the future blockquote these terms of use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware without regard to conflicts of laws provisions you and netflix agree that the united states district court for the northern district of california and or the california superior court for the county of santa clara shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute between you and netflix relating in any way to the netflix service or web site or these terms of use you and netflix expressly and irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in these courts the parties agree that in any such dispute or subsequent legal action they will only assert claims in an individual non class non representative basis and that they will not seek or agree to serve as a named representative in a class action or seek relief on behalf of those other than themselves blockquote releasing this week the netflix website at one time featured a list of titles releasing this week rtw that enabled customers to easily view new dvds the company planned for rental release each week on december 21 2007 the company removed the link to the page without notice and replaced it with a slider system showing only four previously released movies at a time the new page called popular new releases does not list newly released dvds for rental the listing of new releases is still active dynamic queue subscription and delivery methods on april 4 2006 netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that blockbuster inc blockbuster s online dvd rental subscription program violated two patents held by netflix the first cause of action alleged blockbuster s patent infringement infringement of u s patent no 7 024 381 issued april 4 2006 only hours before the lawsuit was filed by copying the dynamic queue of dvds available for each customer netflix s method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send dvds to subscribers and netflix s method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered the second cause of action alleged infringement of patent no 6 584 450 issued june 24 2003 which covers in less detail the subscription rental service as well as netflix s methods of communication and delivery the dispute was ended a year later on june 25 2007 with both companies declining to disclose the terms of their legal settlement except for a statement by blockbuster that it would not have a major impact on its future financial performance blockbuster also said that the company planned to close 282 stores that year to shift focus to its online service the company already had closed 290 stores in 2006 in fall 2006 blockbuster signed a deal with the weinstein company that gave it the exclusive rental rights to the studio s films beginning january 1 2007 this agreement forced netflix to obtain copies from mass merchants or retailers instead of directly from the studio netflix has speculated that the effect of the blockbuster weinstein agreement could result in higher rental costs and or fewer copies of the studio s movies which would limit the number of each movie s dvds that would be available to subscribers at any one time netflix continues to make available weinstein movies including unknown 2006 film unknown school for scoundrels 2006 film school for scoundrels and harsh times among others the first sale doctrine allows netflix and other video rental businesses to offer movies released by the weinstein company but the long term effects of the blockbuster weinstein deal remain uncertain removal of feature since 2004 netflix subscribers could use a feature that allowed them to interact with friends who were also members this feature was meant to tap into the growing popularity of social networking with this feature users could see how their friends rated a movie on that movie s page view what dvds their friends were renting and allow them to leave their friends notes with film recommendations in march 2010 as part of a redesign of its movie details pages the friends feature began to be phased out users could no longer see their friends ratings on movie pages and what remained of the friends section was moved to a small link at the bottom of each page the initial announcement about the redesign on netflix s official blog made no reference to any changes to the friends feature hundreds of angry users posted negative comments and the feedback prompted netflix s vice president of product management todd yellin to post a follow up statement while apologizing for poor communication about the changes yellin stated that the friends feature would continue to be phased out citing figures that only 2 of members used the feature and the company s limited resources to maintain the service netflix users also began using the movie reviews section of the website to post comments protesting the changes support netflix has consistently shown reluctance to support customers using traditional linux based systems and other fully open source operating systems the company continues to support only microsoft windows os x ios and android operating system android relying on microsoft s vendor lock in proprietary microsoft silverlight silverlight technology though google s partially proprietary android and chrome os platforms are essentially based upon linux and other open source software infrastructure netflix has not provided any crossover support for using its proprietary componentry to stream any of its content upon fully free systems such as ubuntu operating system ubuntu and fedora operating system fedora steve swasey netflix vice president of corporate communications told techrepublic that despite the willingness of open source developers to implement digital rights management measures in the media framework application moonlight runtime moonlight an open source implementation of silverlight netflix cannot be everything for everybody all the time on august 9 2011 netflix released a google chrome web store item for chrome os pc and mac however it does not yet enable netflix streaming on linux machines on linux systems running the chrome browser the extension simply redirects users to view netflix com on november 15 2012 patches to the wine software wine compatibility layer to make viewing of netflix on linux and similar systems were announced on november

against netflix alleging netflix failed to caption streaming video library and that netflix misled deaf and hard of hearing customers in june 2011 the national association of the deaf united states national association of the deaf filed a lawsuit against netflix for not providing closed captioning on all of its watch instantly movies the group claims that netflix is violating the americans with disabilities act by not providing equal access on entertainment on november 11 2011 the court denied a netflix motion to dismiss the case in march 2012 netflix announced it had increased the number of programs that are closed captioned almost all netflix ready devices in distribution today including all the game consoles phone apps tablet apps tvs bd players appletv and the roku set top box are capable of rendering captions in july 2012 netflix announced the formation of an experimental project to crowdsourcing crowdsource the closed captioning effort using the amara formerly universal subtitles platform it is claimed that crowdsourced subtitles regardless of whether they are transcriptions or translations are derivative works which copyright infringement infringe copyright if

subsidiary dhl express dhl royal mail japan post india post and many other regional carriers national postal services and air cargo handlers see package delivery and mail pages historically the bulk of ups competition came from inexpensive ground based delivery services such as parcel post parcel post usps or choice logistics but in 1998 fedex expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by mergers and acquisitions acquiring roadway package system rps originally roadway package system and rebranding it as fedex ground in 2000 in 2003 dhl expanded its us operations by acquiring airborne express significantly increasing its presence in the united states and adding more competition in the ground delivery market in response to this ups partnered with the us postal service to offer ups mail innovations a program that allows ups to pick up mail and transfer it to a usps center or destination delivery unit ddu for final distribution this process is also known as zone skipping long used by parcel consolidators this section of operations is branded as surepost within ups more recently the continued growth of online shopping combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation including package delivery has on the natural environment environment has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents for instance the us postal service claims greener delivery of parcels on the assumption that usps letter carriers deliver to each us address six days a week anyway and therefore offer the industry s lowest fuel consumption per delivery other carriers like parcelpool com which specializes in residential package delivery to apo fpo addresses hawaii alaska puerto rico and other us territories arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e tailers for low cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery characteristic features brown the brown color that ups uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called pullman company pullman brown the color is also mentioned in its former advertising slogan what can brown do for you originally founder james e casey wanted the trucks to be yellow but one of his partners charlie soderstrom stated they would be impossible to keep clean and that pullman car or coach pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason font ups commissioned brand consultancy futurebrand to develop its own font ups sans for use in marketing and communication material ups

the ups package car or van is a major symbol of the u s business world with its iconic status referenced in an early 2000s ad campaign following ups sponsorship of dale jarrett in the nascar sprint cup series the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so as people love the truck the classic ups package car is built on a general motors or ford chassis has a manual transmission manual steering and no radio or air conditioning older vehicles are easily recognizable due to their round headlights and turn signals set onto a sculpted fiberglass hood these are either grumman olson or union city body p 500 p 600 or p 800 step vans a recent redesign changed the look replacing the round turn signals with ovoid led ones the cars lack manufacturer s name or badges newer package cars in north america have either a freightliner trucks or navistar international chassis automatic transmissions and power steering are slowly appearing in package cars ups also operates mercedes benz sprinter box vans occasionally with dodge badges as well as dodge grand caravan minivans ups has ordered modec electric vans for its uk and german fleets energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like dhl and fedex when ups ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy typically 20 25 years or more but generally when the body s structural integrity is compromised they are almost always stripped of reusable parts repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up the only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use usually at a large hub prior to scrapping ups trucks and trailers are assigned an ada automotive destruction authorization number and must be crushed under supervision of ups automotive personnel which records the vehicle s destruction as ups does not re sell any of its ground vehicles other trucks ups commonly refers to its tractor trailers as feeders the tractor units are painted the same pullman brown as the package cars while all company owned trailer vehicle trailers are painted gray ups trailers come in a variety of lengths the shortest trailers also known as pups are long longer trailers also known as hogs come in lengths of 45 48 or towing two of the short trailers in tandem are referred to as double pups or a set there are three different types of feeders nbsp flatbed drop frame and intermodal freight

american legislative exchange council alec system design the ups parcel network is based on a spoke hub distribution paradigm hub and spoke model ups operates list of united parcel service hubs centers that feed parcels to hubs where parcels are sorted and forwarded to their destinations centers typically are the point of entry for parcels and send the parcels to one or more hubs a hub is a location where many centers send packages to be sorted and sent back out to other centers or hubs for example a standard ground parcel being shipped from wilmington north carolina to san francisco is picked up by a driver and taken to the wilmington package center where it is loaded on a trailer and driven to greensboro north carolina at greensboro it would be loaded onto a trailer and sent by rail trailer on flatcar in most cases to the oakland california hub there it would then be forwarded to the delivery center in san francisco california loaded onto the delivery vehicle and transported to its final destination the ups air network runs similarly to the ground network through a hub and spoke system though air hubs are typically located at airports so airplanes can quickly be unloaded the packages sorted and the aircraft loaded again centers feed packages to facilities at airports called gateways which in turn send them to an air hub to be sorted and put on another airplane to a final destination gateway and then from there to a center for instance a next day air package traveling from seattle washington to atlanta georgia would be loaded onto an unit load device air container at boeing field just south of seattle and flown to the worldport ups air hub in louisville kentucky from there it would be sorted to a container heading to atlanta to hartsfield jackson international airport and taken by truck from the airport to the delivery center the ups store pricing for non ups products although the ups store provides ups shipping at regular ups rates the ups store has been sometimes criticized for providing united states postal service usps services at prices higher than consumers would have paid for the same services directly from the postal service the ups store allows individuals to ship via usps at varying rates that are not the retail rates the post office charges this is viewed as more of a convenience fee akin to paying a slightly higher price for groceries at a convenience store usps rules allow third party stores to charge extra costs that they deem necessary fuel economy file ups truck 804051 jpg thumb right ups package car in 2004 ups announced that it would save fuel by minimizing left turns because drivers are idle at intersections while waiting to make left turns ups developed software that routes the day s packages with

s impact on the environment ups has also been awarded the clean air excellence award by the united states environmental protection agency because of the alternative fuel program it has developed in

although initially only available on ups com and to high volume shippers they are now widely available through ups shipping systems and ups ready third party shipping systems employee theft ups had an incident of an employee stealing firearms in transit to licensed firearm dealers in 1999 in response to these thefts ups issued a policy that all handguns must be shipped overnight we re trying to protect ourselves from employees stealing and criminals stealing ups spokesman bob godlewski said employment actions in recent years ups had some employment actions brought by the equal employment opportunity commission in eeoc v united parcel service inc a former ups employee took a 12 month leave of absence after she began having symptoms that were later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis ups had a policy allowing employees to take up to 12 months off for medical leave when the employee exhausted this medical leave the eeoc alleges the employee requested an additional two weeks of leave and that she could have returned to her job after those additional two weeks instead of allowing the alleged request for an additional two weeks of leave ups fired her in jackson v united parcel service inc 548 f 3d 1137 8th cir 2008 ups allegedly demoted a black female employee after she caused an accident on her first day on the job the court ruled that the employee failed to make out title vii race and gender discrimination claims because ups promptly reinstated her to her former position and paid her full back pay the court held that a demotion or denial of a promotion even when accompanied by a loss in pay is not an adverse employment action when it is corrected in a timely manner in eeoc v united parcel service inc 2011 u s dist lexis 111464 n d ill sept 28 2011 the united states district court for the northern district of illinois scrutinized agency initiated suits that do not lay out certain basic legal elements based on the supreme court decisions in 2012 the equal employment opportunity commission alleged that ups violated federal employment law when it allowed supervisors and coworkers to discriminate against and harass an employee for being arab and muslim brokerage fees for canadians the normal procedure for residential customers in canada to import goods from the u s by mail is relatively simple they are required to pay 5 goods and services tax canada gst on the item in alberta british columbia saskatchewan manitoba and quebec and higher rates of hst harmonized sales tax in eastern canada and ontario 13 hst plus a c 5 handling fee collected by the canada border services agency cbsa on behalf of canada post this applies for mailed items greater than c 20 and gifts less than c 60 in value this does not apply to items shipped by couriers such as ups when delivering packages in canada ups customs broking brokers clears the item through the cbsa and transfers a cost to the buyer these fees are not disclosed at the time of purchase by the seller as many sellers from the u s are themselves unaware of this as a result there have been two class action lawsuits filed against ups by canadians the first one filed in october 2006 by robert macfarlane a resident of british columbia alleges that the ups brokerage is so harsh and adverse as to constitute an unconscionable practice the second wright v united parcel service canada ltd claims that ups failed to obtain consumers consent to act as a customs broker to disclose the existence and or amount of the brokerage fee and to provide consumers with the opportunity or disclose to them how to arrange for customs clearance by themselves in 2011 the ontario superior court ruled that indeed the brokerage fee was not properly disclosed an appeal was scheduled for june 2012 what happened did the parties settle did the scheduled appeal ever take place user unforgettableid it is possible for a recipient to avoid ups brokerage fees if a parcel is shipped using a ups express premium service this distinction is not limited to canada or to ups as a rule mail import procedures in all countries apply only to items imported by mail i e originated by the exporter s local postal authority for canadians commonly united states postal service usps for delivery by the importer s local postal authority canada post they do not apply to shipments made by courier services such as ups fedex or dhl for example this distinction is specifically noted by u s customs and border protection cbp in its website s page on internet purchases imported into the united states it also warns that imports by courier may come with higher than expected brokerage fees that sometimes exceed the cost of the purchase and that prepaid shipping charges on imports by courier normally do not include duties or brokerage fees the distinction may be sharper in the u s because cbp normally waives duties on mail imports of up to us 200 per day but not on courier imports of any amount use tax the u s equivalent of gst is collected only by the states not by cbp or shippers what makes this case unique is that ups charges a substantial brokerage fee on ground shipments to canada when other canadian small package services apparently charge nothing ups express services or a minimal fee canada post see also big brown 2008 kentucky derby and preakness stakes winner named after the company freight

majority ownership additionally according to the washington post a special irs tax exception given to citi to allow the us treasury to sell its shares at a profit while it still owned citigroup shares which eventually netted 12 nbsp billion according to treasury spokeswoman nayyera haq this irs tax rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations to evade taxes and was never

create the world s largest financial services organization citicorp city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june 16 1812 with 2 nbsp million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september 14 of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the company s name was changed to the national city bank of new york in 1865 after it joined the new u s national banking system and it became the largest american bank by 1895 the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in 1955 which was shortened in 1962 to first national city bank on the 150th anniversary of the company s foundation travelers group file travelers logo png thumb the corporate logo of travelers inc 1993 1998 prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november 1986 after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica financial services primerica a conglomerate that had already bought life insurance life insurer a l williams as well as brokerage firm stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a cross selling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each other s services its non financial businesses were spin out spun off formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december 1993 with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property casualty and life annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business this deal complemented travelers smith barney well as salomon was focused on fixed income and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorp s former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was ultimately abandoned in october 2003 after global settlement a series of financial scandals that tarnished the bank s reputation citicorp and travelers merger on april 6 1998 the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a 140 nbsp billion firm with assets of almost 700 nbsp billion joe plumeri headed the integration of the consumer businesses of travelers group and citicorp after the merger and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of 450 retail banking retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said he s not the spit and polish executive many people expected he s rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble it can t get away anymore with passive selling and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank it was conjectured that he might become a leading contender to run all of citigroup when weill and reed stepped down if he were to effect a big noticeable victory at citibank he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january 2000 in 2000 citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation which until 1989 had been owned by gulf western now part of national amusements the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay 240 nbsp million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in 2001 citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for 1 9 nbsp billion and banamex in august for 12 5 nbsp billion 2002 travelers spin off file the travelers companies svg thumb the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in 2002 the spin off was prompted by the insurance unit s drag on citigroup stock price because traveler s earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september 11 attacks september 11 2001 attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in 2004 forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in 2005 citigroup still heavily sells all forms of insurance but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of their divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february 2007 when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex january 2008 subprime mortgage crisis heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened 2008 the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the glass steagall act regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in 1998 then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june 2006 senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroup s consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold 90 billion of residential mortgages annually bowen s responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit s creditworthiness when bowen first whistleblower blew the whistle in 2006 60 of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80 of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but mortgage fraud were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on 3 november 2007 bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the bank s chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the group s internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005 regardless of the findings of the investigation bowen s charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbannes oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasn t so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroup s role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april 2010 as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april 11 2007 that it would

department denied the account in an e mail to the media stating this account is simply untrue the directive given by the president in march 2009 was to develop a contingency plan for tough restructurings if the government ended up owning large shares of institutions at the conclusion of the stress tests that secretary geithner worked aggressively to put in place as part of the

the world it has a long history in the electronics industry as an integrated circuit maker and a storage products company western digital was founded on april 23 1970 by alvin b phillips a motorola employee as general digital initially and briefly a manufacturer of mosfet mos test equipment it rapidly became a speciality semiconductor maker with start up capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant emerson electric company around july 1971 it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product the wd1402a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter uart history 1970s initially financed with start up capital provided by investors and emerson electric company wdc made its money by selling calculator chips through the early years of the 1970s and by 1975 wdc was the largest independent calculator chip maker in the world the 1973 oil crisis oil crisis of the mid 1970s and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer bowmar instrument changed its fortunes however and in 1976 western digital declared chapter 11 title 11 united states code chapter 11 bankruptcy after this emerson withdrew their support of the company and wdc was on its own wdc introduced several landmark products during this time including the mcp 1600 multi chip microcoded central processing unit cpu the mcp 1600 was used to implement digital equipment corporation dec s pdp 11 lsi 11 system and their own pascal microengine microcomputer which ran the ucsd pascal ucsd p system version iii and ucsd pascal the processor was also used in several single chip floppy disk drive controller chips notably the western digital fd1771 fd1771 however the wd integrated circuit that arguably drove western s forward integration was the 1771 chip the first disk drive formatter controller replacing boards of ttl logic despite a price far higher than average cmos chips of the time it was very successful and extremely profitable 1980s the wd1771 and its kin were wdc s first entry into the data storage industry by the early 1980s they were making hard disk drive controllers and in 1983 they won the contract to provide ibm with controllers for the ibm personal computer at pc at that controller the wd1003 became the basis of the at attachment ata interface which wdc developed along with compaq and control data corporation control data corporation s mpi division now owned by seagate technology starting in 1986 throughout most of the 1980s the family of controllers based on the wd1003 provided the bulk of wdc s revenues and profits and for a time generated enormous corporate growth image paradise vga 1mb 89 png thumb right western digital paradise vga card 8 bit industry standard architecture isa bus circa 1989 much of the mid to late 1980s saw an effort by wdc to use the profits from their ata storage controllers to become a general purpose oem hardware supplier for the pc industry as a result wdc purchased a number of hardware companies these included video card graphics cards through their paradise subsidiary purchased 1986 core logic chipsets by purchasing faraday electronics inc in 1987 scsi controller chips for disk and tape devices by purchasing adsi in 1986 networking wd8003 wd8013 ethernet and wd8003s starlan they did well especially paradise which produced one of the best video graphics array vga cards of the era but storage related chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers in 1986 they introduced the wd33c93 single chip scsi interface which was used in the first 16 bit bus mastering scsi host adapter the wd7000 fasst in 1987 they introduced the wd37c65 a single chip implementation of the pc at s floppy disk controller circuitry and the grandfather of modern super i o chips in 1988 they introduced the wd42c22 vanilla the first single chip ata hard disk controller 1988 also brought what would be the biggest change in wdc s history that year wdc bought the hard drive production assets of pc hardware

interface esdi drives to ata and scsi and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards that year saw the rise of wdc s caviar drives brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems eventually caviar drives were selling so well that wd started to dispose of its other divisions paradise was sold to philips and since disappeared its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to smc networks and its scsi chip business went to future domain which was later bought out by market leader adaptec around 1995 the technological lead that the caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies especially quantum corp and wdc fell into a slump products and ideas of this time didn t go far the portfolio drive a form factor electronics form factor model developed with jt storage was a flop as was the sdx hard disk to cd rom interface wdc s drives started to slip further behind products by other makers and quality began to suffer custom built pc system builders and pc enthusiasts who used to recommend wd above all else were going to the competition particularly maxtor whose products had improved significantly by the late 1990s in an attempt to turn the tide in 1998 wd recruited the help of ibm this agreement gave wd the rights to use certain ibm technologies including giant magnetoresistance giant magneto resistive gmr heads and access to ibm production facilities the result was the expert line of drives introduced in early 1999 the idea worked and wd regained respect in the press and

honeywell took over responsibility of ge s multics operating system a revolutionary operating system started by mit general electric and bell labs multics had numerous features intended to result in high availability so that it would support a computing utility similar to the telephone and electricity services modular hardware structure and software architecture were used to achieve this the system could grow in size by simply adding more of the appropriate resource computing power main memory disk storage etc separate access control lists on every file provided flexible information sharing but complete privacy when needed multics had a number of standard mechanisms to allow engineers to analyze the performance of the system as well as a number of adaptive performance optimization mechanisms and many new novel ideas the design and features of multics greatly influenced the unix operating system superficial influence of multics on unix is evident in many areas including the naming of some commands but the internal design philosophy was quite different focusing on keeping the system small and simple and so correcting some deficiencies of multics because of

in the banking industry madoff fraud jpmorgan chase and its predecessor chemical bank had a relationship with bernard madoff from 1986 to 2008 when madoff revealed to the fbi that his investment advisory business was a ponzi scheme jpmorgan and its predecessors was madoff s primary bank in the later years of the fraud in 2010 irving picard the trustee charged with recovering the money stolen by madoff sued jpmorgan for failing to prevent madoff from defrauding his customers according to the suit chase knew or should have known that madoff s wealth management business was a fraud however chase did not report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until october 2008 when it told the uk serious organised crime agency that the performance of madoff s investments was too good to be true the suit also claimed that chase bankers were making profitable deals with madoff even as risk management executives expressed concern about the nature of madoff s business almost as seriously picard charged that chemical chase s retail bankers failed to perform even basic oversight of madoff s banking activities despite several transactions dating as far back as the 1990s that raised the appearance of money laundering or check kiting picard argued that even a cursory glance at madoff s account activity at chase would have revealed his business could not possibly have been legitimate he also argued that even after chase reported its concerns about madoff s performance to uk officials it did not put any restrictions on madoff s banking activities until his arrest two months later in the fall of 2013 jpmorgan began talks with prosecutors and regulators to settle charges that it turned a blind eye to madoff s actions on january 7 2014 jpmorgan agreed to pay a total of 2 05

york city bank with united states attorney for the southern district of new york preet bharara in the agreement jpmorgan admitted that it and its predecessors failed to report illegal activities on madoff s part as required by the bank secrecy act as early as 1994 bharara filed a two count criminal information charging jpmorgan with bank secrecy act violations but the charges will be dismissed within two years provided that jpmorgan reforms its anti money laundering procedures and cooperates with the government in its investigation the bank agreed to forfeit 1 7 billion the largest forfeiture ever imposed on a bank in american history the government will use that money to help make madoff s victims whole jpmorgan also agreed to pay a 350 million fine to the office of the comptroller of the currency and settle the suit filed against it by picard for 543 million offices although the old chase manhattan bank s headquarters were located at one chase manhattan plaza in

promoting the change of name to visa note the early visa card shown in the ad as well as the image of the bankamericard that it replaced in mid september 1958 bank of america bofa launched its bankamericard credit card program in fresno california fresno california with an initial mailing of 60 000 unsolicited credit cards the original idea was the brainchild of bofa s in house product development think tank the customer services research group and its leader joseph p williams williams convinced senior bofa executives in 1956 to let him pursue what became the world s first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards that is actual working cards not mere applications to a large population williams accomplishment was in the successful implementation of the all purpose credit card not in coming up with the idea by the mid 1950s the typical middle class american already maintained revolving credit accounts with several different merchants which was clearly inefficient and inconvenient due to the need to carry so many cards and pay so many separate bills each month the need for a unified financial instrument was already palpably obvious to the american financial services industry but no one could figure out how to do it there were already charge cards like diners club which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle and by the mid 1950s there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an all purpose credit card fresno was selected for its population of 250 000 big enough to make a credit card work small enough to control initial startup cost bofa s market share of that population 45 and relative isolation to control public relations damage in case the project failed the 1958 test at first went smoothly but then bofa panicked when it confirmed rumors that another bank was about to initiate its own drop in san francisco bofa s home market by march 1959 drops began in san francisco and sacramento by june bofa was dropping cards in los angeles by october the entire state had been saturated with over 2 million credit cards and bankamericard was being accepted by 20 000 merchants however the program was riddled with problems as williams who had never worked in a bank s loan department had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the bank s customers and he resigned in december 1959 twenty two percent of accounts were delinquent not the 4 expected and police departments around the state were confronted by numerous incidents of the brand new crime of credit card fraud both politicians and journalists joined the general uproar against bank of america and its newfangled credit card especially when it was pointed out that the cardholder agreement held customers liable for all charges even those resulting from fraud bofa officially lost over 8 8 million on the launch of bankamericard but when the full cost of advertising and overhead was included the bank s actual loss was probably around 20 million they conducted a massive effort to clean up after williams imposed proper financial controls published an open letter to 3 million households across the state apologizing for the mess they had caused and eventually were able to make the new financial instrument work the original goal of bofa was to offer the bankamericard product across california but in 1965 bofa began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of california bofa itself like all other united states of america u s banks at the time could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 not repealed until 1994 over the following 11 years various banks licensed the card system from bank of america thus forming a network of banks backing the bankamericard system across the united states the drops of unsolicited credit cards continued unabated thanks to bofa and its licensees and competitors until they were outlawed in 1970 due to the serious financial chaos they caused but not before over 100 million credit cards had been distributed into the american population during the late 1960s bofa also licensed the bankamericard program to banks in several other countries which began issuing cards with localized brand names for example in canada an alliance of banks including toronto dominion bank canadian imperial bank of commerce royal bank of canada banque canadienne nationale and scotiabank bank of nova scotia issued credit cards under the chargex name from 1968 to 1977 in france it was known as carte bleue blue card the logo still appears on many french issued visa cards today in the uk the only bankamericard issuer for some years was barclaycard in 1970 the bank of america gave up control of the bankamericard program the various bankamericard issuer banks took control of the program creating national bankamericard inc nbi an independent non stock corporation which would be in charge of managing promoting and developing the bankamericard system within the united states although bank of america continued to issue and support the international licenses themselves by 1972 licenses had been granted in 15 countries in 1974 ibanco a multinational member corporation was founded in order to manage the international bankamericard program in 1976 the directors of ibanco determined that bringing the various international networks together into a single network with a single name internationally would be in the best interests of the corporation however in many countries there was still reluctance to issue a card associated with bank of america even though the association was entirely nominal in nature for this reason in 1975 bankamericard chargex barclaycard carte bleue and all other licensees united under the new name visa which retained the distinctive blue white and gold flag nbi became visa usa and ibanco became visa international the term visa was conceived by the company s founder dee hock he believed that the word was instantly recognizable in many languages in many countries and that it also denoted universal acceptance

an industry practice known as country club billing by the late 1970s however billing statements no longer contained these enclosures but rather a summary statement showing posting date purchase date reference number merchant name and the dollar amount of each purchase at the same time many issuers particularly bank of america were in the process of changing their methods of finance charge calculation initially a previous balance method was used calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior month s statement later it was decided to use average daily balance which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior month s statement several years later new average daily balance in which transactions from previous and current billing cycles were used in the calculation was introduced by the early 1980s many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue

prevention and how to keep that identification and fraud protection standard and non discriminatory other rules govern what creates an enforceable proof of authorization by the cardholder the rules prohibit merchants from imposing a minimum or maximum purchase amount in order to accept a visa card and from charging cardholders a fee for using a visa card some countries have banned the no surcharge rule most notably the uk and australia and retailers in those countries may apply surcharges to any credit card transaction visa or otherwise unlike mastercard visa does permit merchants to ask for photo id although the merchant rule book states that this practice is discouraged as long as the visa card is signed a merchant may not deny a transaction because a cardholder refuses to show a photo id recent complications include the addition of exceptions for non signed purchases by telephone or on the internet and an additional security system called verified by visa for purchases on the internet paywave in september 2007 visa introduced visa paywave a contactless payment technology feature that allows cardholders to wave their card in front of contactless payment terminals without the need to physically swipe or insert the card into a point of sale device this is similar to the mastercard paypass service and the american express expresspay with both using radio frequency identification rfid technology in europe visa has introduced the v pay card which is smart card chip only and personal identification number pin only v me in 2013 visa launched v me an online payment system that removes the need to share card details with retailers the v me service allows users to enter all their personal details and card information then use a single username and password to make purchases from online retailers on the 27th november 2013 v me went live in the uk france spain and poland with nationwide building society being the first financial institution in

windows this was the first time that visa had changed its logo the new logo has a simple white background with the name visa in blue with an orange flick on the v shown in the infobox at the top of this page for the new visa debit and visa electron logo see the relevant pages dove hologram image visa holo png the dove hologram thumb the hologramin 1984 most visa cards around the world began to feature a hologram of a dove on its face generally under the last four digits of the visa number this was implemented as a security feature true holograms would appear 3 dimensional and the image would change as the card was turned at the same time the visa logo which had previously covered the whole card face was reduced in size to a strip on the card s right incorporating the hologram this allowed issuing banks to customize the appearance of the card similar changes were implemented with mastercard cards on older visa cards holding the face of the card under an ultraviolet light will reveal the dove picture dubbed the ultra sensitive dove as an additional security test on newer visa cards the uv dove is replaced by a small v over the visa logo beginning in 2005 the visa standard was changed to allow for the hologram to be placed on the back of the card or to be replaced with a holographic magnetic stripe holomag the holomag card was shown to occasionally cause interference with card readers so visa eventually withdrew designs of holomag cards and reverted to traditional magnetic strips sponsorships olympics and paralympics visa has been a worldwide sponsor of the

college roommates laurence k marshall and vannevar bush along with scientist charles g smith founded the american appliance company in cambridge massachusetts its focus which was originally on new refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics the company s first product was a gaseous helium rectifier that was based on charles smith s earlier astronomy astronomical research of the star zeta puppis the electron tube was christened with the name raytheon light of from the gods and was used in a battery eliminator a type of receiver radio radio receiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large battery electricity batteries this made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive short lived batteries in 1925 the company changed its name to raytheon manufacturing company and began marketing its rectifier under the raytheon brand name with great commercial success in 1928 raytheon merged with q r s company an american manufacturer of electron tubes and switches to form the successor of the same name raytheon manufacturing company in 1933 it diversified by acquiring acme delta company a producer of transformers power equipment and electronic auto parts by the 1930s it had already grown to become one of the world s largest vacuum tube manufacturing companies during world war ii early in world war ii physicists in the united kingdom invented the magnetron a specialized microwave generating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft american companies were then sought by the us government to perfect and mass produce the magnetron for ground based airborne and shipborne radar systems and with support from the massachusetts institute of technology s radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months of being awarded the contract raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems at war s end in 1945 the company was responsible for about 80 percent of all magnetrons manufactured during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon ranked 71st among united states corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts raytheon s research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food in 1945 raytheon s percy spencer invented the

vast majority of raytheon s revenues have been obtained from defense contracts there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the u s department of defense and other u s government departments and agencies e g in the fiscal year 2007 the national science foundation awarded raytheon 152 million in grants more than to any other institution and organization in the country for managing nsf south pole station this along with heavy lobbying has led to perennial charges of influence peddling raytheon for instance contributed nearly a million dollars to various defense related political campaigns in the presidential election year of 2004 spending much more than that on lobbying expenses and there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government for example richard armitage politician richard armitage a former united states deputy secretary of state is linked to the company through consultancy work john m deutch a former u s director of central intelligence sits on the board of directors along with warren rudman a former senator on the other hand raytheon has also been involved in several contract disputes with the u s government u s district judge albert v bryan jr imposed a us dollar 10 000 criminal fine for one felony count of conveyance without authority and 900 000 in civil penalties and damages the documents allegedly gave raytheon an unfair advantage against its competitors in bidding for weapons contracts although the plea only involved 1983 air force documents united states attorney henry hudson said raytheon also illegally obtained a wide range of secret the pentagon pentagon documents disputed claims of the patriot missile during the 1991 gulf war raytheon received widespread publicity in the united states in connection with its manufacture of the patriot missile mim 104 patriot the patriot missile is an anti aircraft missile that was upgraded to have some capability against ballistic missiles the patriot had allegedly intercepted scud missiles launched by iraq in its defense against the u s led invasion when president george h w bush traveled to raytheon s patriot manufacturing plant in andover massachusetts during the gulf war he declared the patriot is 41 for 42 42 scuds engaged 41 intercepted after the gulf war had concluded the staff of the house government operations subcommittee on legislation and national security reported the patriot missile system was not the spectacular success in the persian gulf war that the american public was led to believe there is little evidence to prove that the patriot hit more than a few scud missiles launched by iraq during the gulf war and there are some doubts about even these engagements the public and the united states congress were misled by definitive statements of success issued by administration and raytheon representatives during and after the war contract disputes in october 1994 raytheon paid 4 million to settle a u s government claim that it inflated a defense contract for antimissile radar the pave paws precision acquisition vehicle entry phased array warning system system was designed to detect incoming submarine launched ballistic missiles the government claimed in a federal lawsuit that raytheon inflated a contract to upgrade two of four pave paws sites by proposing to hire higher skilled employees than were necessary for the job the boston herald reported that ages alleged that the security firm wackenhut wackenhut corporation hired by raytheon used video and audio surveillance to espionage spy on a consulting firm hired by ages to help it prepare its bid ages also alleged that stolen confidential pricing documents were turned over to raytheon both raytheon and ages had been vying for the contract which raytheon had held for decades but which ages won in 1996 on may 12 1999 reuters reported that raytheon would pay 3 million to ages group and purchase 13 million worth of ages aircraft parts to settle the ages lawsuit the settlement was exceptional in that the parties agreed that judgment law judgment would be entered against raytheon legally establishing the validity of ages allegations securities litigation in october 1999 raytheon was the subject of a number of securities class action lawsuits alleging it had issued a series of materially false and misleading statements including overstating the company s 1997 and 1998 revenues concealing cost overruns and inflating its financial results the suits were brought in response to a massive drop in value of raytheon s common stock as traded on the new york stock exchange on tuesday october 12 1999 raytheon shares were trading at about 45 below the level at which they had been traded on october 11 1999 the plunge in stock prices was triggered by a wall street journal report that raytheon was over cost or behind schedule on more than a dozen fixed price defense contracts this crash represented a loss of about 8 billion in market value in a single day on may 13 2004 raytheon reported that it had reached a preliminary agreement to pay 410 million in cash and securities to settle a class action lawsuit alleging it misled investors by not disclosing difficulties on various pentagon and construction projects five years before swanson s unwritten rules of management on april 24 2006 in a

evolutions and tdscdma td scdma as well as patents on 4g the license streams from the patents on these inventions and related products are a major component of qualcomm s business in june 2011 qualcomm announced that it will be releasing a set of application programming interfaces geared to give web based applications deeper links into hardware satellite phone network beginning in 1991 qualcomm participated in the development of the globalstar satellite system along with loral space communications it uses a low earth orbit leo satellite constellation consisting of 44 active satellites the system is used for voice telephony via hand held satellite phones asset tracking and data transfer using mobile satellite modems the system was designed as a normal is 95 system and used the satellite as a bent pipe or repeater to transfer cellular signals from the handset to the terrestrial base station unlike the iridium system which routes phone calls between satellites the globalstar satellite must always be able to see both the handset and the base station to establish a connection therefore there is no coverage over the earth s poles where there are no satellite orbits there is also no coverage in locations where the large globalstar base stations are not in view some locations in the south atlantic for examples some of the globalstar hardware is manufactured by qualcomm like other satellite phone networks globalstar went bankrupt in 1999 only to be bought up by a group of investors who are currently running the system those investors plan to launch a

qualcomm employees had lied about their involvement in 2009 qualcomm and broadcom entered into a settlement and multi year patent agreement ending all litigation between the companies in 2012 a federal probe was launched into the company s compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act which bars companies as well as individuals from bribing foreign officials to gain business qualcomm s role in 3g the current umts air interfaces are for the most part based on qualcomm patents and royalties from these patents represent a significant part of qualcomm s revenue this followed a series of patent related lawsuits and antitrust complaints spearheaded by broadcom in the us in 2006 broadcom started a series of patent related lawsuits and antitrust complaints against qualcomm to get what broadcom regarded fair terms for access to the w cdma technologies broadcom was soon joined by nokia and others and complaints were also filed in the european commission in 2007 the european commission launched an inquiry into qualcomm s possible abusing its dominant position in the market for third generation phones the complaints were first lodged in 2005 by leading handset

qualcomm gobi is a mobile broadband chipset used mainly for cellular data networking and it is also now used in a few enterprise smart phones e g motorola es400 it currently is a 3g technology capable up to high speed packet access hspa on gsm and ev do rev a on cdma carriers the gobi chipset is a microprocessor that can load a specific carrier image so that the device appears to be specifically designed for that carrier s network since gsm and cdma are quite different and since gobi devices can switch between them both using the same silicon their solution is considered to be innovative gobi technology is best suited for large enterprise customers where a single mobile operator cannot serve all of their wireless modem needs since there is not one carrier that was provide the same level of service in all the places they need that service the gobi solution allows the it department to roll out a single module on their laptop builds which can be configured to behave exactly like a device that is locked to the carrier that they want to use in that area in the united states exactly the same hardware can be used on the cdma network or the gsm network of their choice for gsm users that travel out of the united states the gobi solution can be used to avoid international roaming charges by switching the sim and the device s carrier image to a local provider instead of incurring the roaming charges in both scenarios the customer must have different wireless accounts with each provider they wish to use natively it typically takes 20 seconds for the device to load the carrier image into nvram and reset and come back online gobi 3000 is the next hardware revision of the gobi platform and it natively supports hspa the model for gobi 3000 is different it is a reference design the oems can licence and produce their own gobi 3000 compliant modules with their own extensions qualcomm does not sell any gobi 3000 silicon the reference design allows the same boilerplate hardware and software components for the basis of oem chips which allow the oems to focus on innovations on the mobile broadband platform rather than getting bogged down with low level rf implementations future gobi platforms will support lte natively currently some gobi 3000 modules support lte through their own extensions mirasol displays mirasol displays are the world s first and only reflective bistable display based on interferometric modulator display imod technology qualcomm s mirasol displays use ambient light as their source of illumination and consume almost no power when the image is unchanged

resonant inductive coupling created from more than 10 years of research at auckland university software operating system brew qualcomm brew binary runtime environment for wireless is a proprietary cell phone application platform brew is designed so that the platform rejects unsigned applications in order to have an application signed a developer must pay a testing fee to http www nstl com national software testing labs nstl which then can approve or deny the request this allows carriers to maintain control over the applications that run on their customers phones bitpim is a popular open source program which can access the embedded filesystem on phones using qualcomm msms via a cable or bluetooth it should be pointed out that signing systems are also used in apple ios java me and signing is often required by wireless carrier carriers and original equipment manufacturer oems speech codec qualcomm has developed an audio codec for speech called purevoice which besides use on

2012 folding its mobile focused ea interactive eai division into other organizations throughout the company specifically those divisions led by ea labels president frank gibeau coo peter moore and cto rajat taneja and evp of digital kristian segerstrale 1982 1991 in february 1982 trip hawkins arranged a meeting with don valentine of sequoia capital to discuss financing his new venture amazin software valentine encouraged hawkins to leave apple inc in which hawkins served as director of product marketing and allowed hawkins use of sequoia capital s spare office space to start the company on may 28 1982 trip hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated seven months later in december 1982 hawkins secured of venture capital from sequoia capital kleiner perkins caufield byers and sevin rosen funds file electronic arts historical logo svg thumb left 300px electronic arts original corporate logo 1982 2000 for more than seven months hawkins refined his electronic arts business plan with aid from his first employee with whom he worked in marketing at apple rich melmon the original plan was written mostly by hawkins on an apple ii in sequoia capital s office in august 1982 during that time hawkins also employed two of his former staff from apple dave evans and pat marriott as game producer producers and a stanford mba classmate jeff burton from atari for international business development the business plan was again refined in september and reissued on october 8 1982 between september and november employee headcount rose to 11 including tim mott bing gordon david maynard and steve hayes having outgrown the office space provided by sequoia capital the company relocated to a san mateo california san mateo office that overlooked the san francisco international airport san francisco airport landing path headcount rose rapidly in 1983 including don daglow richard hilleman stewart bonn david gardner and nancy fong he recruited his original employees from apple atari xerox parc and visicorp and got steve wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers combined with the fact that hawkins was pioneering new game brands this made sales growth more challenging retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners after more flyers were handed out former ceo larry probst arrived as vp of sales in late 1984 and helped the company sustain growth into in its third full year this policy of dealing directly with retailers gave ea higher margins and better market awareness key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog its early competitors in december 1986 david gardner and mark lewkaspais moved to the uk to open a european headquarters up until that point publishing of electronic arts games and the conversion of many of their games to compact cassette versions in europe was handled by ariolasoft most of the early employees of the company disliked the amazin software name that hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated the company while at apple hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at pajaro california pajaro dunes and organized such a planning offsite for ea in october 1982 hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers software artists hence the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name softart however hawkins and melmon knew the founders of software arts the creators of visicalc and thought their permission should be obtained dan bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar perhaps confusingly similar to software arts however the name concept was liked by all the attendees hawkins had also recently read a best selling book about the film studio united artists and liked the reputation that company had created early advisers andy berlin jeff goodby and rich silverstein who would soon form their own ad agency goodby silverstein partners were also fans of that approach and the discussion was led by hawkins and berlin hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleep hawkins liked the word electronic and various employees had considered the phrases electronic artists and electronic arts other candidates included gordon s suggestion of blue light a reference from the disney film tron when gordon and others pushed for electronic artists in tribute to the film company united artists steve hayes opposed saying we re not the artists they are meaning that the developers whose games ea would publish were the artists this statement from hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards electronic arts and the name was unanimously endorsed a novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of ea s trademarks in its early days this characterization was even further reinforced with ea s packaging of most of their games in the album cover pioneered by ea because hawkins thought that a record album style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling in the mid 1980s electronic arts aggressively marketed products for the commodore amiga mistakenly believing that its low price and sophistication would cause the computer to supplant the apple macintosh pc compatibles instead became the dominant personal computer in 1990 electronic arts began producing console games for the nintendo entertainment system after previously licensing its computer games to other console game publishers eventually trip hawkins left ea to found the now

several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the national football league nfl and in january 2005 a 15 year deal with espn the espn deal gave ea exclusive first rights to all espn content for sports simulation games on april 11 2005 ea announced a similar 6 year licensing deal with the collegiate licensing company clc for exclusive rights to college football content much of ea s success both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation is due to its strategy of platform agnostic development and the creation of strong multi year franchises ea was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises madden fifa nhl nba live tiger woods etc with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers ea announced in 2006 that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property in september 2006 nokia and

publishing the city state model the goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously streamline decision making increase creativity and quality and get games into the market faster this reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by ea of smaller studios which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of ea titles in 2008 at the dice summit riccitiello called the earlier approach of buy and assimilate a mistake often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent riccitiello said that the city state model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent and cited maxis and bioware as examples of studios thriving under the new structure also in 2007 ea announced that it would be bringing some of its major titles to the macintosh ea has released battlefield 2142 command conquer tiberium wars crysis harry potter and the order of the phoenix madden nfl 08 need for speed carbon and spore 2008 video

marketing and demographics in the days and weeks ahead we will make further announcements on the reporting structure for the other businesses in the casual label including ea mobile pogo media sales

grasshopper manufacture shank video game shank klei entertainment syndicate 2012 video game syndicate starbreeze studios titanfall respawn entertainment warp 2012 video game warp trapdoor company trapdoor criticism studio acquisition and management practices during its period of fastest growth ea was often criticized for buying smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property assets and then producing drastically changed games of their franchises for example origin systems origin produced ultima viii ultima viii pagan and ultima ix ultima ix ascension were developed quickly under ea s ownership over the protests of ultima creator richard garriott and these two are widely considered to be subpar compared to the rest of the series in early 2008 ceo john riccitiello acknowledged that this practice by ea was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater autonomy without meddling in their corporate culture and decided to go with ea partners despite having a poor opinion of the publisher s past record blockquote i ll admit that if you asked me years ago i still had thoughts that ea was the evil empire the company that crushes the small studios i d have been surprised if you told me a year ago that we d end up with ea as a publisher when we went out and talked to people especially ea partners people like valve corporation valve we got almost uniformly positive responses from them blockquote like other ea partners such as harmonix mtv games carmack stressed that ea partners deal isn t really a publishing arrangement instead they really offer a menu of services valve takes one set of things crytek takes a different set and we re probably taking a third set though in some of the cases the shutdown was merely a reformation of teams working at different small studios into a single studio in the past magic carpet 2 was rushed to completion over the objections of designer peter molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major bugs studios such as origin and bullfrog productions had previously produced games attracting significant fanbases many fans also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down but some developers for example the eala studio have stated that they try to carry on the legacy of the old studio westwood studios once ea received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large groups of employees during the closure of a studio however later it was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or another countering early rumors that the teams were specifically targeted countering the implication that the under performance of certain games might have been the catalyst ea was once criticized for the acquisition of 19 9 percent of shares of its competitor ubisoft a move that ubisoft s then spokesperson initially described as a hostile act however ubisoft ceo yves guillemot later indicated that a merger with ea was a possibility stating the first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it the second option is to work with the movie industry and the third is to merge however in july 2010 ea elected to sell its reduced 15 percent share in ubisoft that share equated to roughly treatment of employees in 2004 electronic arts was criticized for employees working extraordinarily long hours up to 100 hours per week and not just at crunch times leading up to the scheduled releases of products the publication of the ea spouse blog with criticisms such as the current mandatory hours are 9 nbsp a m to 10 nbsp p m seven days a week with the occasional saturday evening off for good behavior at 6 30 pm the company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought by game artists to compensate for unpaid overtime the class was awarded as a result many of the lower level developers artists programmers producers and designers are now working at an hourly rate a similar suit brought by game programmer programmers was settled for since these criticisms first aired it has been reported that ea has taken steps to address work life balance concerns by focusing on long term project planning compensation and communication with employees these efforts accelerated with the arrival of john riccitiello as ceo in february 2007 in december 2007 an internal ea employee survey showed a 13 increase in employee morale and a 21 increase in perception of management recognition over a three year period in may 2008 ea spouse blog author erin hoffman speaking to videogame industry news site gamasutra stated that ea had made significant progress but may now be falling into old patterns again hoffman said that i think ea is tremendously reformed having made some real strong efforts to get the right people into their human resources department and i ve been hearing from people who have gotten overtime pay there and i think that makes a great deal of difference in fact i ve actually recommended to a few people i know to apply for jobs there but she also said she has begun to hear horror stories once again game quality for 2006 the games review aggregation site metacritic gives the average of ea games as 72 0 out of 100 2 5 points behind nintendo 74 5 but ahead of the other first party publishers microsoft studios game studio microsoft 71 6 and sony computer entertainment sony 71 2 the closest third party publisher is take two interactive publishing as 2k games and rockstar games at 70 3 the remaining top 10 publishers sega thq ubisoft activision square enix all rate in the mid 60s since 2005 ea has published eight games that received universal acclaim metacritic score 90 or greater battlefield 2 crysis rock band video game rock band fifa 12 fifa 13 mass effect 2 mass effect 3 and dragon age origins ea s aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during competitive seasons pacific crest securities analyst evan wilson had said poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the ea brand according to our ongoing survey of gamerankings com aggregated review data electronic arts overall game quality continues to fall although market share has not declined dramatically to date in years such as 2007 which promises to have tremendous competition it seems likely if quality does not improve ea had also received criticism for developing games that lack innovation vis vis the number of gaming titles produced under the ea brand that show a history of yearly updates particularly in their sporting franchises these typically retail as new games at full market price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental changes to game mechanics the user interface and graphics one critique compared ea to companies like ubisoft and concluded that ea s innovation in new and old ips crawls along at a snail s pace while even the company s own ceo john riccitiello acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally saying we re boring people to death and making games that are harder and harder to play for the most part the industry has been rinse and repeat there s been lots of product that looked like last year s product that looked a lot like the year before ea has announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game ips in order to stem this trend with recently acquired and critically acclaimed studios bioware and pandemic would be contributing to this process in 2012 ea s games were ranked highest of all large publishers in the industry according to metacritic in june 2013 ea attracted criticism from users for replacing its scrabble app on facebook with a new version that did not retain players histories and statistics the new version added functionality including support for other languages and board customization anti trust lawsuit on june 5 2008 a lawsuit was filed in oakland california oakland california alleging electronic arts is breaking united states anti trust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the nfl players association the ncaa and arena football league to use players names likenesses and team logos this keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements the suit further accuses ea of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action in an interview with gametap peter moore said it was the nfl that sought the deal to be clear the nfl was the entity that wanted the exclusive relationship ea bid as did a number of other companies for the exclusive relationship moore said it wasn t on our behest that this went exclusive we bid and we were very fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee more recently ea has been sued by former ncaa players for allegedly using their images without compensation eula and drm in the september 2008 release of ea s game spore 2008 video game spore it was revealed that the digital rights management drm scheme included a program called securom and a lifetime machine activation limit of three 3 instances a huge public outcry over this drm scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed amazon com with one star ratings and critical reviews of the game in order to get ea to pay attention to their consumers this drm scheme which was intended to hinder the efforts of pirates to illegally use and distribute ea software instead mainly affected paying customers as the game itself was pirated well before release on september 13 2008 it was announced that spore was the most pirated game ever with over half a million illegal downloads within the first week of release in response to customer reaction ea officially announced its release of upcoming command conquer red alert 3 would increase the installation limit to 5 rather than 3 on september 22 2008 a global class action lawsuit was filed against ea regarding the drm in spore complaining about ea not disclosing the existence of securom in the game manual and addressing how securom runs with the nature of a rootkit including how it remains on the hard drive even after spore is uninstalled on october 14 2008 a similar class action lawsuit was filed against ea for the inclusion of drm software in the free demo version of the creature creator on march 31 2009 ea released a de authorization management tool that allows customers who have installed games containing the securom activation scheme to de authorize a computer freeing up one of the five machine slots to be used on another machine on june 24 2009 ea announced and formalized a change in its approach to preventing piracy of pc games the company plans to drop all drm from its games replacing it with a traditional cd key check however games will include content that is not present on the disc requiring a download during the activation of the game the intent is to create an incentive to buy a legitimate copy of the game a general policy has been laid out with plans envisioning games more as services with a lot of content to freely download or buy linked to the game some goodies and regular updates as a way to coax players to use the genuine copies of ea games in 2013 ea received criticism regarding its always on drm persistent online authentication system as implemented in the simcity 2013 video game simcity reboot advertising ea s advertising campaign for dead space 2 was at first admired but soon described as sexist and ageist with some claiming that it was reinforcing out dated stereotypes against female and older gamers the game is rated m for mature and is therefore only recommended for players over the age of seventeen others thought the advertisements were pointless and would hurt market share the video game s campaign hinges on a unique premise one that ignores how much the culture of gaming has changed as of 2010 40 of console only gamers were women and the average game player was 34 years old for the advertising campaign 200 women were selected for their conservative values and lack of familiarity with video games their reactions to a screening of the game were featured in ea s web and tv advertisements with the campaign slogan your mom hates dead space 2 on february 24 2011 the extra credits team at the time on the escapist magazine the escapist published the episode an open letter to ea marketing denouncing electronic arts marketing decisions for the dante s inferno video game dante s inferno medal of honor series medal of honor and dead space 2 releases they argue that ea s decisions to hire fake protesters and market games solely on shock value while neglecting to defend the medal of honor on a 1st amendment basis for letting the player play as the taliban have been hurtful to the gaming industry they also argue that the advertisements are counterproductive to electronic arts wishes to elevate games to an art medium as demonstrated in the 1980s electronic arts ad can a computer make you cry the consumerist worst company in america in april 2012 the consumerist awarded ea with the title of worst company in america along with a ceremonial golden poo trophy the record breaking poll drew in more than 250 000 votes and saw ea beating out such regulars as at t and walmart the final round of voting pitted ea against bank of america ea won with 50 575 votes or 64 03 this result came in the aftermath of the mass effect 3 controversy mass effect 3 ending controversy which several commentators viewed as a significant contribution to ea s win in the poll other explanations include use of day one downloadable content dlc and ea s studio acquisition and management practices habit of acquiring smaller developers to squash competition ea spokesman john reseburg responded to the poll by saying we re sure that british petroleum aig philip morris usa philip morris and halliburton are all relieved they weren t nominated this year we re going to continue making award winning games and services played by more than 300 million people worldwide in april 2013 ea won the consumerist s poll for worst company in america a second time consecutively becoming the first company to do so games mentioned in the announcement included the critically controversial mass effect 3 for its ending dead space 3 for its use of micro transactions and the more recent simcity 2013 video game simcity reboot due to its simcity 2013 video game release poorly handled launch additionally poor customer support nickel and diming and public dismissiveness of criticisms were also given as explanations for the results of the poll the consumerist summarized the results by asking when we live in an era marked by massive oil spills faulty foreclosures by bad banks and rampant consolidation in the airline and telecom industry what does it say about ea s business practices that so many people have for the second year in a row come out to hand it the title of worst company in america when asked about the poll by venturebeat frank gibeau president of ea labels responded we take it seriously and want to see it change in the last few months we have started making changes to the business practices that gamers clearly don t like gibeau attributes the elimination of online passes the decision to make the sims 4 a single player offline experience as well as the unveiling of more new games to the shift in thinking the point is we are listening and we are changing gibeau said the settlement is reported to be around 40 million dollars to be paid to between 200 000 and 300 000 players battlefield 4 downloadable content bugs lawsuit on december 19 2013 ea was hit with class action lawsuit over the bugs in the battlefield 4 dlc ea issued a statement regarding the various issues and bugs of the game and promised players that these issues would be fixed before the launch of the next generation consoles this was not the case as players on both the playstation 4 and xbox one had the same problems the problems were so severe that they made certain parts of the game unplayable due to campaign save files being corrupted and players being unable to start or join multiplayer servers players expressed their outrage on the online forum forums of battlelog ea answers hq and social news sites such as reddit ea dice

through a complex petroleum pricing scheme involving a project in indonesia chevron and texaco before they merged in 2001 each owned 50 percent of a joint venture called caltex which pulled crude oil from the ground in a project with the indonesian state oil company pertamina chevron was accused of reducing its tax liabilities in the u s by buying oil from caltex at inflated prices one internal chevron document set the price it paid pertamina for oil at 4 55 a barrel higher than the prevailing market price chevron was then able to overstate deductions for costs on its u s income tax returns indonesia appeared to levy tax on this oil at 56 a rate far higher than the corporate tax rate in the u s because the united states gives companies a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments tax paid to the indonesian government reduces tax to the u s government environmental damage in ecuador file texaco in ecuador jpg thumb right oil pollution in lago agrio november 2007 texaco and gulf oil began operating in the oriente region of ecuador in 1964 as a consortium texaco operated the lago agrio oil field from 1972 to 1993 and the ecuador state oil company continued to operate the same oil fields after texaco left in 1993 texaco was found responsible for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste and they spent 40m cleaning up the area during the 1990s in 1998 the ecuadorean government signed an agreement with texaco accepting the clean up as complete and absolving texaco of any further responsibility in 1998 an ecuadorean scientific team took water and soil samples after texaco left and found petroleum hydrocarbons at unsafe levels in almost half the clean up was called a sham by critics chevron claimed that the 1998 agreements with the ecuadorian government exempted the company from any liabilities in 2011 ecuadorian residents were awarded 8 6 billion based on claims of loss of crops and farm animals as well as increased local cancer rates the plaintiffs said this would not be enough to make up for the damage caused by the oil company the award was later revised to 19 billion on appeals which was then appealed again to the ecuadorean national court of justice the action is considered the first time that indigenous people have successfully sued a multinational corporation in the country where the pollution took place in february 2013 a three person tribunal acting under the hague s permanent court of arbitration said the ecuador government should have stopped plaintiffs in the case from going to courts in brazil argentina and canada to try to collect the judgment handed down by an ecuadorean court in 2011 a spokesperson for the plaintiffs said the courts hearing enforcement actions would likely pay little attention to the tribunal since it was not binding on the rain forest communities in may 2013 justice david brown of the ontario superior court stayed the action but ruled that the canadian courts have no jurisdiction to enforce the award ruled by an ecuadorian court in june 2013 argentina s supreme court revoked an embargo on the assets and future income of chevron s argentina subsidiary in september 2013 the hague arbitration panel ruled in favor of chevron finding that an agreement signed in 1995 by the government of ecuador released texaco corporation from financial responsibility from any claims of collective damage however the panel left open the possibility that chevron could still be liable for damages incurred by individuals pollution in richmond california chevron s activities at its century old chevron richmond refinery richmond refinery have been the subject of ongoing controversy the project generated over 11 million pound mass pounds of toxic materials and caused more than 304 accidents the richmond

production of hazardous gases upgraded leak detection and repair procedure reduced emissions from sulfur recovery plants and adopted strategies to ensure the proper handling of harmful benzene wastes at refineries nimh battery technology for automobiles chevron was accused to be limiting access to large nimh batteries through its stake in cobasys corporation and control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline this culminated in a lawsuit against panasonic and toyota over production of the ev 95 battery used in the rav4 ev chevron s influence over cobasys extends beyond a strict 50 50 joint venture as it held a 19 99 interest in ecd ovonics in her book plug in hybrids the cars that will recharge america published in february 2007 sherry boschert argues that large format nimh batteries are commercially viable but that cobasys refuses to sell the batteries or license the technology to small companies or individuals boschert argues that cobasys accepts only very large orders for the batteries major automakers showed little interest in placing large orders for large format nimh batteries however toyota complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format nimh batteries to service the existing 825 rav 4evs because no other companies were willing to place large orders cobasys was not manufacturing or licensing large format nimh battery technology for automobiles boschert concludes that it s possible that cobasys chevron is squelching all access to large nimh batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline or it s possible that cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug in hybrids or electric vehicles in an interview with the economist the ecd ovonics founder stan ovshinsky subscribed to the former view i think we at ecd we made a mistake of having a joint venture with an oil company frankly speaking and i think it s not a good idea to go into business with somebody whose strategies would put you out of business rather than building the business in addition chevron maintained the right to seize all of cobasys intellectual property rights if ecd ovonics does not fulfill its contractual obligations on september 10 2007 chevron filed a legal claim that ecd ovonics has not fulfilled its obligations ecd ovonics disputes this claim in october 2007 international acquisitions services and innovative transportation systems filed suit against cobasys and its parents for refusing to fill an order for large format

the 154 workers on board and a fire that burned for 46 days before the well was sealed on june 18 according to a reuters news report workers on the ks endeavor were ignored by chevron when they requested evacuation due to concerns of increasing smoke billowing from the drilling borehole a senior worker said the blowout was triggered by a massive build up of pressure a witness said that rig engineers advised chevron to stop drilling and evacuate staff but chevron told them to continue with drilling expecting an explosion the rig manager one of the two that later died kept the lifeboats at hand and ready for use a witness reported this is the reason so many of us survived because we were all aware that it was going to happen but just didn t know when in an email response to reuters

clearance certificate by not informing the ministry about the cracks that had occurred in nearby residents properties due to explosions caused by their activities polish gas exploration chevron has experienced mass protests aimed at the company by local communities in southern poland when they started gas exploration in the region their complaint is that chevron didn t provide all of the documents required for gas exploration in poland and that the company has not promised to share a percentage of the revenues with the local landholders the landholders of the region view chevron s presence in the region negatively since they may be forced to sell their properties at a low cost if gas is discovered in the region as well potential environmental disasters are a concern for local farmers another of the residents primary concern is water pollution from the chemicals used in fracking in response to some of the protests chevron has sued some of the protesters from urawl w for disrupting their operations according to gas and oil expert andrzej szczesniak one of the main reasons for the protest is the difference between polish and american law in the usa property owners typically receive 15 20 from the income of gas exploration though in poland the discovery of gas on private property usually results in a forced sale of the property with the owner receiving only the prior value of the land and no percentage of the gas revenue this is the result of outdated communist era laws that are still on the books and which are often exploited by municipal governments if the

resulted in the first commercially owned computer installation in the united states in 1954 joe glickauf an early pioneer of computer consulting held a position as head of arthur andersen s

andersen increased its use of accounting services as a springboard to sign up clients for andersen consulting s more lucrative business through the 1990s there was increasing tension between andersen consulting and arthur andersen andersen consulting was upset that it was paying arthur andersen up to 15 of its profits each year a condition of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit aa or

its employees customers or shareholders a dispute in 2004 with communication workers of america cwa a labor union that represented many employees at comcast s offices in beaverton oregon led to

of america for its policies in regards to unions criticism and controversy image comcast service van jpg thumb 250px right comcast service van ypsilanti township michigan in 2004 and 2007 the american customer satisfaction index acsi survey found that comcast had the worst customer satisfaction rating of any company or government agency in the country including the internal revenue service the acsi indicates that almost half of all cable customers regardless of company have registered complaints and that cable is the only industry to score below 60 in the acsi comcast s customer service rating by the acsi surveys indicate that the company s customer service has not improved since the surveys began in 2001 analysis of the surveys states that comcast is one of the lowest scoring companies in acsi as its customer satisfaction eroded by 7 over the past year revenue increased by 12 the acsi analysis also addresses this contradiction stating that such pricing power usually comes with some level of monopoly protection and most cable companies have little competition at the local level this also means that a cable company can do well financially even though its customers are not particularly satisfied comcast spends millions of dollars annually on government relationships comcast employs the spouses sons and daughters of mayors councilmen commissioners and other officials to assure its continued preferred market allocations references external links http www secdatabase com cik 1166691 company name comcast corp comcast sec filings http www mediadb eu en datenbanken

operating segment 13 percent of sales oversees energy management at dow dow originally only sold bleach and potassium bromide achieving a bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902 early in the company s existence a group of economy of the united kingdom british manufacturers attempted to drive dow out of the bleach business by cutting prices dow survived by also cutting its prices and although losing about 90 000 in income began to diversify its product line in 1905 german bromide producers began dumping bromides in the u s in an effort to prevent dow from expanding its sales of bromides in europe instead of competing head on with the german producers dow bought the cheap german made bromides and shipped them back to europe undercutting his german competitors even in its early history dow set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its product line within twenty years dow had become a major producer of agricultural chemicals elemental chlorine phenol and other dyestuffs and magnesium metal during world war i dow chemical supplied many war materials previously imported from germany dow produced magnesium for incendiary flares chlorobenzene monochlorobenzene and phenol for explosives and bromine for medicines and tear gas by 1918 90 percent of dow chemical production was geared towards the war effort at this time dow created the diamond logo that is still used by the company after the war dow continued research in magnesium the result of which were refined automobile pistons which produced more speed and better fuel efficiency the dowmetal pistons were used heavily in racing vehicles and the 1921 winner of the indianapolis 500 used the dowmetal pistons in his vehicle the freeport plant is now home to dow s largest site and one of the largest integrated chemical manufacturing sites in the world the site grew quickly with power chlorine caustic soda and ethylene also soon in production in 1942 dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of dow chemical of canada in sarnia ontario to produce styrene for use in styrene butadiene synthetic rubber also during the war dow and corning inc corning began their joint venture dow corning to produce silicones for military and later civilian use the ethyl dow chemical co plant at kure beach north carolina kure s beach nc the only plant on the east coast producing bromine from seawater was attacked by a german u boat in 1942 in the post war era dow began expanding outside of north america founding its first overseas subsidiary in economy of japan japan in 1952 and in several other nations soon thereafter based largely on its growing plastics business dow opened a consumer products division beginning with saran wrap in 1953 based on its growing chemicals and plastics businesses dow s sales

produced plutonium triggers for hydrogen bombs contamination from fires and radioactive waste leakage plagued the facility under dow s management in 1957 a fire burned plutonium dust in the facility and sent radioactive particles into the atmosphere in 1967 of lubricants and solvents laden with plutonium leaked into the ground another fire in 1969 was the costliest industrial accident in the united states up to that time management of the facility was handed over to rockwell international in 1975 in 1990 a class action lawsuit was filed against dow and rockwell in 2008 a federal judge ordered dow and rockwell to pay a combined 925 million in damages to citizens however in september 2010 the tenth circuit court of appeals reversed the decision according to the appellate court the owners of 12 000 properties in the class action area had not proved that their properties were damaged or that they had suffered bodily injury from the plutonium that blew onto their properties vietnam war napalm and agent orange the united states military dropped napalm bombs on north vietnam during the vietnam war dow was one of several manufacturers who began producing the napalm b compound under government contract from 1965 after experiencing protests and negative publicity the other suppliers discontinued manufacturing the product leaving dow as the sole provider the company said that it carefully considered its position and decided as a matter of principle its first obligation was to the government despite a boycott of its products by anti war groups and harassment of recruiters on some college campuses dow continued to manufacture napalm b until 1969 dow corning breast implants a major manufacturer of silicone breast implants dow corning dow chemical s joint venture with corning inc was sued for personal damages caused by ruptured implants on october 6 2005 all such cases pending in the district court against the company were dismissed the company stated should cases involving dow corning s breast implant and other silicone medical products be filed against the company in the future they will be accorded similar treatment bhopal disaster union carbide became a subsidiary of dow chemical in 2001 the bhopal disaster of 1984 occurred at a pesticide plant owned by union carbide india ltd a subsidiary of union carbide 17 years before dow chemical co s acquisition a gas cloud containing mic and other chemicals spread to the neighborhoods near the plant where more than half a million people were exposed to it more than 27 years after the event the actual number of fatalities is still unknown the official immediate death toll was 2 259 and the government of madhya pradesh has confirmed a total of 3 787 deaths related to the gas release others estimate 3 000 died within weeks and another 8 000 have since died from gas related diseases there are wide variations in the estimated number of individuals permanently disabled by the event by one independent estimate 40 000 individuals were left permanently disabled maimed or suffering from serious illness as a result of the disaster while a government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused approximately 3 900 severely and permanently disabling injuries union carbide was sued by the government of india and agreed to an out of court settlement of us 470 million in 1989 in 2010 eight former executives of union carbide india ltd were found guilty of death by negligence activists are seeking to have dow chemical held responsible for the ongoing cleanup of the site now under the control of the state government of madhya pradesh dbcp until the late 1970s dow produced dbcp 1 2 dibromo 3 chloropropane a soil fumigant and nematicide sold under the names the nemagon and fumazone workers at dow s dbcp production plants were made sterile by exposure to the compound these effects were consistent with animal experiments showing that dbcp sterilized rabbits the workers successfully sued the company and most domestic uses of dbcp were banned in 1977 amid growing concerns over the chemical s effects on male workers dow ceased production and reclaimed dbcp that had been shipped to its users despite warning from the company about its health effects dole food company dole food co who was using the chemical on its banana plantations in latin america threatened to sue dow if it stopped dbcp shipments so dow shipped of dbcp to dole much it reclaimed from other users plantation workers who became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued both dow and dole in latin american courts alleging that their ailments were caused by dbcp exposure while the courts agreed with the workers and awarded them over 600 million in damages they have been unable to collect any payment from the companies a group of workers then sued in the united states and on november 5 2007 a los angeles jury awarded them 3 2 million dole and dow vowed to appeal the decision on april 23 2009 a los angeles judge threw out two cases against dole and dow due to fraud and extortion by lawyers in nicaragua recruiting fraudulent plaintiffs to make claims against the company the ruling casts doubt on 2 billion in judgments in similar lawsuits recent mergers acquisitions and reorganization 1990s transition from geographic alignment to global business units in the early 1990s dow embarked on a major structural reorganization the former reporting hierarchy was geographic based with the regional president reporting directly to the overall company president and ceo the new organization combines the same businesses from different sites irrespective of which region they belong i e the vice president for polystyrene is now in charge of these plants all over the world almost reducing the regional president to a figurehead in 1995 dow was fined 732 000 for failing to notify the environmental protection agency of reports it had received of 249 poisoning incidents by its pesticide dursban in june 2000 dow withdrew registration of chlorpyrifos for use in homes and other places where children could be exposed and severely restricted its use on crops the company however continues to market dursban in developing countries including india where dow s sales literature claimed dursban has an established record of safety regarding humans and pets in 2003 dow agreed to pay 2 million the largest penalty ever in a pesticide case to the state of new york in response to a lawsuit filed by the attorney general to end dow s illegal advertising of dursban as safe union carbide merger at the beginning of august 1999 dow agreed to purchase union carbide corporation union carbide corp ucc for 9 3 nbsp billion in stock at the time the combined company was the second largest chemical company behind dupont this led to protests from some stockholders who feared that dow would become tarnished for ucc s role in the bhopal disaster bill stavropoulos served as president and chief executive officer from 1995 to 2000 then again from 2002 to 2004 he relinquished his board seat on april 1 2006 having been a director since 1990 and chairman since 2000 during his first tenure he led the purchase of ucc which proved controversial as it was blamed for poor results under his successor as ceo mike parker parker was dismissed and stavropoulos returned from retirement to lead dow 2006 2008 restructuring on august 31 2006 dow announced that it had plans to close facilities at five locations sarnia ontario was dow s first manufacturing site in canada in 1942 the canadian government invited dow to build a plant there to produce styrene an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for world war ii dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947 up to the early 1990s the chemical valley site contained numerous plants while dow canada s headquarters were located at the highway 40 ontario modeland centre and a new river centre complex was opened which housed research and development since then several plants dow terminology for a production unit on the site have been dismantled and the dow canada headquarters moved to calgary alberta the dow fitness centre was donated to ymca of sarnia lambton and the modeland centre was sold to lambton county and the city of sarnia in 2002 the steam plant was demolished and land on the site was sold to transalta which built a natural gas power plant one plant at its site in barry south wales a triple string str styrene polymer production unit integral in the company s development of the super high melt foam specific polymers styron a tech high gloss high impact polymers one plant at its site in porto marghera venice italy which had been shut down for planned maintenance earlier that

2007 dow announced a series of moves to revamp the company a december 4 announcement revealed that dow planned to exit the automotive sealers business in 2008 or 2009 within several weeks dow also announced the formation of a joint venture later named k dow with the petrochemical industries co pic a subsidiary of kuwait petroleum corporation kuwait petroleum corp in exchange for 9 5 nbsp billion dow sold a 50 percent interest in five of its global businesses polyethylene polypropylene and polycarbonate plastics and ethylenamines and ethanolamines rohm haas co purchase on july 10 2008 dow agreed to buyout purchase all of the common stock common equity interest of rohm and haas co for 15 4 billion which equates to 78 for each share the buyout will be financed with equity investments of 3 billion by berkshire hathaway inc and 1 billion by the kuwait investment authority the purpose of the deal is to move dow chemical further into specialty chemicals which offer higher profit margins than the commodities market and are more difficult to enter for the competition the purchase has been criticized by many on wall street who believe dow chemical overpaid about a 75 percent premium on the previous day s market capital to acquire the company however the high bid was needed to ward off competing bids from basf the transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of rohm and haas closed on april 1 2009 accelerated implementation on december 8 2008 dow announced that due to the 2008 economic crisis it would accelerate job cuts resulting from its reorganization the announced plan includes closing 20 high cost facilities temporarily idling 180 plants and eliminating 5 000 full time jobs about 11 percent of their work force and 6 000 contractor positions strategy interruption citing the global recession that began in the latter half of 2008 the kuwaiti government scuttled the k dow partnership on december 28 2008 the collapse of the deal dealt a blow to andrew liveris vision of restructuring the company to make less economic cycle cyclical however on january 6 2009 dow chemical announced they were in talks with other parties who could be interested in a major joint venture with the company they also announced they would be seeking to recover damages related to the failed joint venture from pic the deal was expected to be finalized in early 2009 and was to form one of the nation s largest specialty chemicals firms however on january 26 2009 the company informed rohm and haas that it would be unable to complete the transaction by the agreed upon deadline dow cited a deteriorated credit market and the collapse of the k dow petrochemical deal as reasons for failing to timely close the merger around the same time ceo andrew liveris said a first time cut to the company s 97 year old dividend policy was not off the table on february 12 2009 the company declared a quarterly dividend of 0 15 share down from 0 42 the previous quarter the cut represented the first time the company had diminished its investor payout in the dividend s 97 year history after negotiating the sale of preferred stock with rohm and hass largest two stockholders and extending their one year bridge loan an additional year the company purchased rohm and haas for 15 billion 78 a share on march 9 2009 focus on higher margin business dow chemical has begun to shed commodity chemical businesses such as those making the basic ingredients for grocery bags and plastic pipe because their profit margins only average 5 10 dow is focusing resources on specialty chemicals that earn margins of 20 chlorpyrifos chlorpyrifos marketed by dow as dursban is well known as a home and garden insecticide until 2000 it was one of the most widely used household pesticide in the us the pesticide is also a nerve toxin and suspected endocrine disruptor and has been associated with carcinogenicity reproductive and developmental toxicity and acute toxicity pesticide action network a hazardous pesticide elimination advocacy group estimated dow contributed 80 percent of human exposure to chlorpyrifos based on their estimate of dow s market share in 2004 dioxin contamination areas along michigan s tittabawassee river which runs within yards of dow s main plant in midland michigan midland were found to contain elevated levels of the cancer causing chemical polychlorinated dibenzodioxins dioxin in november 2006 the dioxin was located in sediments two to ten feet below the surface of the river and according to the new york times there is no indication that residents or workers in the area are directly exposed to the sites however people who often eat fish from the river had slightly elevated levels of dioxin in their blood in november 2008 dow chemical along with the united states environmental protection agency and michigan department of environmental quality agreed to establish a superfund to address dioxin cleanup of the tittabawassee river saginaw river and saginaw bay environmental record according to the united states environmental protection agency epa dow has some responsibility for 96 of the united states superfund toxic waste sites placing it in 10th place by number of sites one of these a former ucc uranium and vanadium processing facility near uravan colorado is listed as the sole responsibility of dow the rest are shared with numerous other companies fifteen sites have been listed by the epa as finalized cleaned up and 69 are listed as construction complete meaning that all required plans and equipment for cleanup are in place in 2007 the chemical industry trade asscociation the american chemical council gave dow an award of exceptional merit in recognition of longstanding energy efficiency and conservation efforts between 1995 and 2005 dow reduced energy intensity btu per pound produced by 22 percent this is equivalent to saving enough electricity to power eight million us homes for a year the same year dow subsidiary dow agrosciences won a united nations montreal protocol innovators award for its efforts in helping replace methyl bromide a compound identified as contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer in addition dow agrosciences won an epa best of the best stratospheric ozone protection award the united states environmental protection agency epa named dow as a 2008 energy star partner of the year for excellence in energy management and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 dow was reported as being the major supplier of pesticides based on aminopyralid which had contaminated manure and caused widespread loss of vegetable crops in allotments and gardens across the uk board of directors current members of the board of directors of the dow chemical co are arnold allemang adviser the dow chemical co ajay banga president ceo mastercard jacqueline barton chemistry professor california institute of technology however in june 2008 dow chemical and the litigants announced a settlement in which kreinberg and reinhard dropped their lawsuits and admitted taking part in discussions which were not authorized by nor disclosed to dow s board concerning a potential lbo and acknowledged that it would have been appropriate to have informed the ceo and board of the talks major sponsorships in july 2010 dow became a worldwide partner of the olympic games the sponsorship extends to 2020 in september 2004 dow obtained the naming rights to the saginaw county event center in saginaw michigan the center is now called the dow event center the saginaw spirit of the ontario hockey league plays at the center which also hosts events such as professional wrestling and live theater in october 2006 dow bought the naming rights to the stadium used by the great lakes loons a midwest league single a minor league baseball team located in its hometown of midland michigan the stadium is called dow diamond the dow foundation played a key role in bringing the loons to the city in 2010 dow signed a 100m 63m 10 year deal with the international olympic committee and agreed to sponsor the 7m olympic stadium wrap dow also sponsors nascar major collaborations lab safety academy on may 20 2013 dow launched the dow lab safety academy a website that includes a large collection of informational videos and resources that demonstrate best practices in laboratory safety the goal of the website is to improve awareness of safety practices in academic research laboratories and to help the future chemical workforce develop a safety mindset as such the dow lab safety academy is primarily geared toward university students however dow has made the content open to all including those already employed in the chemical industry the dow lab safety academy is also available through the safety and chemical engineering education program an affiliate of american institute of chemical engineers aiche and the campbell institute an organization focusing on environment health and safety practices the dow lab safety academy is one component of dow s larger laboratory safety initiative launched in early 2012 following a report from the u s chemical safety board that highlighted the potential hazards associated with conducting research at chemical laboratories in academic institutions seeking to share industry best practices with academia dow partnered with several u s research universities to improve safety awareness and practices in the departments of chemistry chemical engineering engineering and materials through the pilot programs with u c santa barbara ucsb university of minnesota and pennsylvania state university dow worked with graduate students and faculty to identify areas of improvement and develop a culture of laboratory safety nature conservancy in january 2011 the nature conservancy and the dow chemical co announced a collaboration to integrate the value of nature into business decision making scientists engineers and economists from the nature conservancy and dow are working together at three pilot sites north america latin america and tbd to implement and refine models that support corporate decision making related to the value and resources nature provides those ecosystem services include water land air oceans and a variety of plant and animal life these sites will serve as a living laboratories to validate and test methods and models so they can be used to inform more sustainable business decisions at dow and hopefully influence the decision making and business practices of other companies outlook dow ceo andrew n liveris called 2005 the company s best year ever with operating profits of 5 4 billion a jump of 56 5 percent compared with the previous year net income rose more than 60 percent to 4 5 billion on sales of 46 3 billion 2006 looks as if it could be even better with first quarter net earnings of 1 2 billion all this is occurring in the context of adverse operating conditions caused by high energy and raw material costs and the effects of two damaging hurricanes liveris supports the vertically integrated approach used at dow which produces everything from basic chemical feedstocks to high value products such as pesticides and reverse osmosis membranes these value adding product chains along with dow s wide product range help the company to weather the storms of the global economy despite this high energy and feedstock costs may begin to take their toll particularly if global demand begins to fall just as supply is rising like many chemical companies dow is facing pressures of regulation in the us and economy of the european union europe particularly as the european union eu introduces its new registration evaluation and authorisation of chemicals reach policy litigation costs in the us taken over by dow as a result of its 2001 takeover of union carbide also remain a concern for these reasons dow is looking to the middle east and asia for new projects in kuwait dow is constructing with petrochemical industries company pic of kuwait a new world scale petroleum cracking ethane cracker for production of ethylene along with an ethylene oxide ethylene glycol plant and for 2008 a facility for production of aromatic hydrocarbons in oman the company is working with the oman government to build a new world scale polyethylene plant in china the company is collaborating with shenhua group the country s largest coal mining company to improve catalyst efficiency to allow viable conversion of coal to alkene olefins dow is also seeking to expand its research and development r d presence in asia adding 600 jobs in shanghai by the end of 2007 and the company may open up a large r d center in india the joint ventures planned for asia are typical of dow s asset light approach which works by offering a combination of intellectual property and money in exchange for a share in a world scale production facility at the same time dow is considering selling a share of some of its existing assets in order to free up cash in june 2006 liveris announced dow s safety and environmental goals for 2015 subsidiaries dow agrosciences dow agrosciences llc

established by oliver chace in 1839 as the valley falls company in valley falls rhode island chace had previously worked for samuel slater the founder of the first successful textile mill in america chace founded his first textile mill in 1806 in 1929 the valley falls company merged with the berkshire cotton manufacturing company established in 1889 in adams massachusetts the combined company was known as berkshire fine spinning associates in 1955 berkshire fine spinning associates merged with the hathaway mills hathaway manufacturing company which was founded in 1888 in new bedford massachusetts by horatio hathaway with profits from whaling and the china trade hathaway mills hathaway was successful in its first decades but it suffered during a general decline in the textile industry after world war i at this time hathaway mills hathaway was run by seabury stanton whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the great depression depression after the merger berkshire hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12 000 workers with over 120 nbsp million in revenue and was headquartered in new bedford massachusetts however seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade accompanied by large layoffs in 1962 warren buffett began buying stock in berkshire hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill eventually buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company s financial situation was not going to improve in 1964 stanton made an oral tender offer of 11 per share for the company to buy back buffett s shares buffett agreed to the deal a few weeks later warren buffett received the tender offer in writing but the tender offer was for only 11 buffett later admitted that this lower undercutting offer made him angry instead of selling at the slightly lower price buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire stanton which he did however this put buffett in a situation where he was now majority owner of a textile business that was failing buffett initially maintained berkshire s core business of textiles but by 1967 he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of national indemnity company in the late 1970s berkshire acquired an equity stake in the government employees insurance company geico which forms the core of its insurance operations today and is a major source of capital for berkshire hathaway s other investments in 1985 the last textile operations hathaway s historic core were shut down in 2010 buffett claimed that purchasing berkshire hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made

in troubled asset relief program tarp money from the united states department of treasury buffett owned 32 4 aggregate voting power of berkshire s shares outstanding and 23 3 of the economic value of those shares berkshire s vice chairman charlie munger also holds a stake big enough to make him a billionaire and early investments in berkshire by david gottesman and franklin otis booth jr resulted in their becoming billionaires as well bill gates cascade investments llc is the second largest shareholder of berkshire and owns more than 5 of class b shares berkshire hathaway is notable in that it has never stock split split its class a shares which not only contributed to their high per share price but also significantly reduced the liquidity of the stock this refusal to split the stock reflects the management s desire to attract long term investors as opposed to short term speculation speculators however berkshire hathaway has created a class b stock with a per share value originally kept by specific management rules close to of that of the original shares now class a and of the per share voting rights and after the january 2010 split at the price and the voting rights of the class a shares holders of class a stock are allowed to convert their stock to class b though not vice versa buffett was reluctant to create the class b shares but did so to thwart the creation of unit investment trust unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as berkshire look alikes as buffett said in his 1995 shareholder letter the unit trusts that have recently surfaced fly in the face of these goals they would be sold by brokers working for big commissions would impose other burdensome costs on their shareholders and would be marketed en masse to unsophisticated buyers apt to be seduced by our past record and beguiled by the publicity berkshire and i have received in recent years the sure outcome a multitude of investors destined to be disappointed berkshire s annual

typically start with a movie made for berkshire shareholders the 2004 movie featured arnold schwarzenegger in the role of the warrenator who travels through time to stop buffett and munger s attempt to save the world from a mega corporation formed by microsoft starbucks wal mart schwarzenegger is later shown arguing in a gym with buffett regarding california proposition 13 1978 proposition 13 the 2006 movie depicted actresses jamie lee curtis and nicollette sheridan lusting after munger the meeting scheduled to last six hours is an opportunity for investors to ask buffett questions the salary

old ted weschler founder of peninsula capital advisors will join berkshire in early 2012 as a second investment manager in berkshire hathaway s annual shareholder letter dated february 25 2012 buffett said that his successor as ceo had been chosen internally but not named publicly while the intent of this message was to bolster confidence in the leadership of a buffett less berkshire critics have noted that this strategy of choosing a successor without a concrete exit strategy for the sitting ceo often leaves an organization with fewer long term options while doing little to calm shareholder fear in reaction to the announcement stephen a miles a leadership consultant who specializes in ceo succession noted you see this more often with successful founder ceos because they re so good they

attempted to use federal antitrust antitrust laws to break up u s steel in 1911 but that effort ultimately failed time and competitors have however accomplished nearly the same thing in its first full year of operation u s steel made 67 percent of all the steel produced in the united states one hundred years later its shipments accounted for only about 8 percent of domestic consumption production peaked at more than 35 million tons in 1953 its employment was greatest in 1943 when it had more than 340 000 employees by 2000 however it employed 52 500 people on february 4 1987 three days after

defeated union organizing efforts by william z foster of the afl later a leader of the communist party usa during the 1920s u s steel like many other large employers coupled paternalistic employment practices with employee representation plans erps which were company unions sponsored by management these erps eventually became an important factor leading to the organization of the united steelworkers of america the company dropped its hard line anti union stance in 1937 when myron taylor then president of u s steel agreed to recognize the steel workers organizing committee an arm of the congress of industrial organizations cio led by john l lewis taylor was an outsider brought in during the great depression to rescue u s steel and had no emotional investment in the company s long history of opposition to unions watching the upheaval caused by the united auto workers successful sit down strike in flint michigan flint michigan and convinced that lewis was someone he could deal with on a businesslike basis taylor sought stability through collective bargaining the steelworkers continue to have a contentious relationship with u s steel but far less so than the relationship that other unions had with employers in other industries in the united states they launched a number of long strikes against u s steel in 1946 and a steel strike of 1959 116 day strike in 1959 but those strikes were over wages and benefits and not the more fundamental issue of union recognition that led to violent strikes elsewhere the steelworkers union attempted to mollify the problems of competitive foreign imports by entering into a so called experimental negotiation agreement ena in 1974 this was to provide for arbitration in the event that the parties were not able to reach agreement on any new collective bargaining agreements thereby preventing disruptive strikes the ena failed to stop the decline of the steel industry in the u s u s steel and the other employers terminated the ena in 1984 in 1986 steel strike of 1986 u s steel employees stopped work after a dispute over contract terms characterized by the company as a strike action strike and by the union as a lockout industry lockout in a letter to striking employees in 1986 johnston warned there are not enough seats in the steel lifeboat for everybody in addition to reducing the role of unions the steel

of mountain view california mountain view california to dulles virginia dulles in northern virginia by 2011 due to 95 of the company s business being on the east coast of the united states east coast history verisign was founded in 1995 as a spin off of the rsa security certification services business the new company received licenses to key cryptographic patents held by rsa and a time limited non

applications making it the largest ca behind the encryption and authentication on the internet which most people recognize as the small padlock icon in their web browser when shopping online or logging into a secure website in 2000 verisign acquired network solutions which operated the com net and org tlds under agreements with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann

operators which are non profit organizations in this role verisign maintains the zone files for these particular domains and host the domains from their domain servers registry operators are the wholesalers of internet domain names while domain name registrars act as the retailers working directly with consumers to register a domain name address verisign also operates two of the internet s 13 root servers which are identified by the letters a m verisign operates the a and j root servers the root servers form the top of the hierarchical domain name system that supports all internet communication verisign also generates the globally recognized root zone file and is also responsible for processing changes to that file once they are ordered by icann and approved by the us department of commerce changes to the root zone were originally distributed via the a root server but now they are distributed to all 13 servers via a separate distribution system which verisign maintains verisign is the only one of the 12 root server operators to operate more than one of the 13 root nameservers the a and j root servers are anycasted and are no longer operated from any of the company s own datacenters as a means to increase redundancy and availability and mitigate the threat of a single point of failure verisign s naming services division dates back to 1993 when network solutions was awarded a contract by the national science foundation to manage and operate the civilian side of the internet s domain name registrations network solutions was the sole registrar for all of the internet s non governmental generic top level domains until 1998 when icann was established and the new system of competitive registrars was implemented as a result of these new policies network solutions divided itself into two divisions the nsi registry division was established to manage the authoritative registries that the company would still operate and was separated from the customer facing registrar business that would have to compete with other registrars the divisions were even geographically split with the nsi registry moving from the corporate headquarters in herndon virginia to nearby dulles virginia in 2000 verisign purchased network solutions taking over its role in the internet dns the nsi registry division eventually became verisign s naming services division while the remainder of network solutions was later sold by verisign in 2003 to pivotal equity group trust seals verisign is also offering trust seal products for e commerce sites competing in this space with truste better business bureau bbb online and webtrust company properties following the sale of its authentication services division in 2010 verisign relocated from its former headquarters

dulles virginia not far from its corporate headquarters within the large broad run technology park one at 21 boulden circle in new castle delaware and a third in fribourg switzerland their three data

office is located it also has leased server space in numerous internet data centers around the world where the dns constellation resolution sites are located mostly at major internet peering facilities one such facility is at the equinix ashburn datacenter in ashburn virginia one of the world s largest datacenters and internet transit hubs controversies 2001 code signing certificate mistake in january 2001 verisign mistakenly issued two class 3 code signing certificates to an individual claiming to be an employee of microsoft the mistake was not discovered and the certificates revoked until two weeks later during a routine audit because verisign code signing certificates do not specify a certificate revocation list distribution point however there was no way for them to be automatically detected as having been revoked placing microsoft s customers at risk microsoft had to later release a special security patch in order to revoke the certificates and mark them as being fraudulent 2002 domain transfer law suit in 2002 verisign was sued for domain slamming transferring domains from other registrars to themselves by making the registrants believe they were merely renewing their domain name although they were found not to have broken the law they were barred from suggesting that a domain was about to expire or claim that a transfer was actually a renewal 2003 site finder legal case in september 2003 verisign introduced a service called site finder which redirected web browsers to a search service when users attempted to go to nonexistent com or net domain names icann asserted that verisign had overstepped the terms of its contract with the united states department of commerce u s department of commerce which in essence grants verisign the right to operate the domain name system dns for com and net and verisign shut down the service subsequently verisign filed a lawsuit against icann in february 2004 seeking to gain clarity over what services it could offer in the context of its contract with icann the claim was moved from federal to california state court in august 2004 in late 2005 verisign and icann announced a proposed settlement which defined a process for the introduction of new registry services in the com registry the documents concerning these settlements are available at icann org the icann comments mailing list archive documents some of the criticisms that have been raised regarding the settlement additionally verisign was involved in the sex com matter decided by the ninth circuit 2003 gives up org domain in keeping with icann s charter to introduce competition to the domain name marketplace verisign agreed to give up its operation of org top level domain in 2003 in exchange for a continuation of its contract to operate com which at the time had more than 34 million registered addresses 2005 retains net domain in mid 2005 the existing contract for the operation of net expired and five companies including verisign bid for management of it verisign s bid was backed by numerous it and telecom heavyweights including microsoft ibm sun microsystems mci and others which all asserted that verisign had a perfect record operating net they proposed verisign continue to manage the net dns due to its critical importance as the domain underlying numerous backbone network services on june 8 2005 icann announced that verisign had been approved to operate net until 2011 more information on the net bidding process is available at icann 2010 data breach and disclosure controversy in february 2012 verisign revealed that their network security had been repeatedly breached in 2010 verisign stated that the breach did not impact the domain name server dns system that they maintain but would not provide details about the loss of data verisign was widely criticized for not disclosing the breach earlier and apparently attempting to hide the news in an october 2011 sec filing because of the lack of details provided by verisign it was not clear whether the breach impacted the certificate signing business acquired by symantec in late 2010 according to oliver lavery the director of security and research for ncircle network security ncircle can we trust any site using verisign ssl certificates without more clarity the logical answer is no as registry operator for com verisign performed the required takedowns of the 82 sites under order from law enforcement informationweek reported that verisign will say only that it received sealed court orders directing certain actions to be taken with respect to specific domain names the removal of the 82 websites was cited as an impetus for the launch of the dot p2p project in order to create a decentralized dns service without centralized registry operators following the disappearance of wikileaks during the following week and its forced move to wikileaks ch a swiss domain the electronic frontier foundation warned of the dangers of

that they issued 250 000 cards prior to the official launch date the card was launched with an annual fee of 6 1 higher than diners club to be seen as a premium product the first cards were paper with

all purchases whether a balance was carried on the card or not as opposed to traditional revolving credit cards which charge interest on new purchases if so much as 1 was carried over the card was discontinued a few years later the now discontinued one from american express card offered a similar feature called interest protection boston fee party from early 1980s until the early 1990s american express was known for cutting its interchange fee merchant fees also known as a discount rate to merchants and restaurants if they accepted only american express and no other credit or charge cards this prompted competitors such as visa inc visa and mastercard to cry foul for a while as the tactics locked restaurants into american express the practice ended in 1991 as several restaurants in boston started accepting and encouraging the use of visa and mastercard because of their far lower fees as compared to american express fees at the time which were about 4 for each transaction versus around 1 2 at the time for visa and mastercard a few even stopped accepting american express credit and charge cards the revolt known as the boston fee party alluding to the boston tea party was orchestrated by a pr firm hired and paid by discover card the campaign spread to over 250 restaurants across the united states including restaurants in other cities such as new york city chicago and los angeles in response american express reduced its discount rate gradually to compete more effectively and add new merchants such as supermarkets and drugstores to its network many elements of the exclusive acceptance program were also phased out and american express pursued other programs to effectively encourage businesses to add american express cards to their existing list of payment options cable tv american express formed a joint venture with warner communications in 1979 called warner amex satellite entertainment which created mtv nickelodeon and the movie channel the partnership lasted only until 1984 the properties were sold to viacom 1971 2005 viacom soon after conversion to bank holding company on november 10 2008 during the financial crisis of 2007 2010 financial crisis of 2008 the company won federal reserve system approval to convert to a bank holding company making it eligible for government help under the troubled asset relief program at that time american express had total consolidated assets of about 127 nbsp billion controversy in the uk in november 2010 the uk division of american express was cautioned by the office of fair trading for the use of controversial charging orders against those in debt the regulator said that the company was one of four companies who were encouraging customers to turn their unsecured credit card debts into a form of secured debt loyalty acquisition in march 2011 american express completed a 685m purchase of loyalty partner which operates the payback loyalty program in germany and poland and the i mint loyalty program in india business model typical credit card business model when a consumer makes a purchase using a credit or charge card a small portion of the price is paid as a fee known as the merchant discount with the merchant keeping the remainder there are typically three parties who split this fee amongst themselves acquiring bank the bank which processes credit card transactions for a merchant including crediting the merchant account merchant s account for the value charged to a credit card less all fees issuing bank the bank which issues the consumer s credit card this is the bank a consumer is responsible for repaying after making a credit card purchase the issuer s share of the merchant discount is known as the interchange fee network the link between acquiring banks and issuing banks these banks have relationships with a network rather than with each other for fulfilling card purchases this allows a card issued by a community bank in peru to be used at a shop in south africa for instance without requiring the banks to have a direct relationship with each other the two largest networks in the world are visa inc visa and mastercard american express operates its own network the average merchant discount in the united states is 1 9 of this approximately 0 1 goes to the acquirer 1 7 to the issuer and 0 09 to the network most prime and superprime card issuers use the majority of their interchange revenue to fund loyalty programs like frequent flyer program frequent flyer points and cashback reward program cash back and hence their profit from card spending

president of the european central bank mark carney governor of the bank of canada 2008 13 and governor of the bank of england from july 2013 history 1869 1930 goldman sachs was founded in new york city new york in 1869 by the germany german born marcus goldman in 1882 goldman s son in law samuel sachs joined the firm in 1885 goldman took his son henry and his son in law ludwig dreyfuss into the business and the firm adopted its present name goldman sachs co the company made a name for itself pioneering the use of commercial paper for entrepreneurs and was invited to join the new york stock exchange nyse in 1896 in the early 20th century goldman was a player in establishing the initial public offering ipo market it managed one of the largest ipos to date that of sears roebuck and company in 1906 it also became one of the first companies to heavily recruit those with mba degrees from leading business schools a practice that still continues today on december 4 1928 it launched the goldman sachs trading corp a closed end fund the fund failed as a result of the stock market crash of 1929 hurting the firm s reputation for several years afterward of this case and others like blue ridge corporation and shenandoah corporation john kenneth galbraith wrote the autumn of 1929 was perhaps the first occasion when men succeeded on a large scale in swindling themselves 1930 1980 in 1930 sidney weinberg assumed the role of senior partner and shifted goldman s focus away from trading and towards investment banking it was weinberg s actions that helped to restore some of goldman s tarnished reputation on the back of weinberg goldman was lead advisor on the ford motor company ford motor company s ipo in 1956 which at the time was a major coup on wall street under weinberg s reign the firm also started an investment research division and a municipal bond department it also was at this time that the firm became an early innovator in risk arbitrage gus levy joined the firm in the 1950s as a securities trader which started a trend at goldman where there would be two powers generally vying for supremacy one from investment banking and one from securities trading for most of the 1950s and 1960s this would be weinberg and levy levy was a pioneer in block trade block trading and the firm established this trend under his guidance due to weinberg s heavy influence at the firm it formed an investment banking division in 1956 in an attempt to spread around influence and not focus it all on weinberg in 1969 levy took over as senior partner from weinberg and built goldman s trading franchise once again it is levy who is credited with goldman s famous philosophy of being long term greedy which implied that as long as money is made over the long term trading losses in the short term were not to be worried about at the same time partners reinvested almost all of their earnings in the firm so the focus was always on the future that same year weinberg retired from the firm another financial crisis for the firm occurred in 1970 when the penn central transportation company went bankrupt with over 80 nbsp million in commercial paper outstanding most of it issued through goldman sachs the bankruptcy was large and the resulting lawsuits notably by the u s securities and exchange commission sec threatened the partnership capital life and reputation of the firm it was this bankruptcy that resulted in credit ratings being created for every issuer of commercial paper today by several credit rating services during the 1970s the firm also expanded in several ways under the direction of senior partner stanley r miller it opened its first international office in london in 1970 and created a private wealth management private wealth division along with a fixed income division in 1972 it also pioneered the white knight business white knight strategy in 1974 during its attempts to defend electric storage battery against a hostile takeover bid from international nickel and goldman s rival morgan stanley this action would boost the firm s reputation as an investment advisor because it pledged to no longer participate in hostile takeovers john weinberg john l weinberg the son of sidney weinberg and john c whitehead assumed roles of co senior partners in 1976 once again emphasizing the co leadership at the firm one of their initiatives was the establishment of 14 business principles that the firm still claims to apply 1980 1999 on november 16 1981 the firm acquired j aron company a commodities trading firm which merged with the fixed

firm joined david rockefeller and partners in a 50 50 joint ownership of rockefeller center during 1994 but later sold the shares to tishman speyer in 2000 in 1996 goldman was lead underwriter of the yahoo ipo and in 1998 it was global coordinator of the ntt docomo ipo in 1999 henry paulson took over as senior partner since 1999 one of the largest events in the firm s history was its own initial

goldman was able to profit from the collapse in subprime mortgage bonds in the summer of 2007 by short finance short selling subprime mortgage backed securities two goldman traders michael swenson and josh birnbaum are credited with being responsibile for the firm s large profits during the crisis the pair members of goldman s structured products group in new york city new york made a profit of 4 nbsp billion by betting on a collapse in the sub prime market and shorting mortgage related securities by summer 2007 they persuaded colleagues to see their point of view and convinced skeptical risk management executives the firm initially avoided large subprime writedowns and achieved a net profit due to significant losses on non prime securitization securitized loans being offset by gains on short mortgage positions its sizable profits made during the initial subprime mortgage crisis led the new york times to proclaim that goldman sachs is without peer in the world of finance the firm s viability was later called into question as the crisis intensified in september 2008 on october 15 2007 as the crisis had begun to unravel allan sloan a senior editor for fortune magazine fortune

according to a 2009 brandasset valuator survey taken of 17 000 people nationwide the firm s reputation suffered in 2008 and 2009 and rival morgan stanley was respected more than goldman sachs a

agreement goldman sachs came under criticism in 2013 for entering into a three year consulting agreement with the russian direct investment fund and russia s economy ministry of vladimir putin s government to attract foreign investment human rights foundation chairman garry kasparov commented on the agreement saying goldman sachs s deal with putin ranks among the worst examples ever of a company seeking to bolster its profits by laundering the financial reputation of a country led by a corruptly elected despot personnel revolving door with u s government during 2008 goldman sachs received criticism for an apparent revolving door politics revolving door relationship in which its employees and consultants have moved in and out of high level u s government positions creating the potential for conflicts of interest the large number of former goldman employees in the us government has been jokingly referred to government sachs former treasury secretary paulson was a former ceo of goldman sachs additional controversy attended the selection of former goldman sachs lobbyist mark a patterson mark patterson as chief of staff to treasury secretary timothy geithner despite president barack obama s campaign promise that he would limit the influence of lobbyists in his administration in february 2011 the washington examiner reported that goldman sachs was the company from which obama raised the most money in 2008 and that its ceo lloyd blankfein has visited the white house 10 times insider trading cases in 1986 david brown entrepreneur david brown was convicted of passing inside information to ivan boesky on a takeover deal robert freeman who was a senior partner who was the head of risk arbitrage and who was a prot g of robert rubin was also convicted of insider trading for his own account and for the firm s account in april 2010 goldman director rajat gupta was named in an insider trading case it was said gupta had tipped off a hedge fund billionaire raj rajaratnam of galleon group about the 5 nbsp billion berkshire hathaway investment in goldman in financial crisis 2007 present impacts on financial institutions september 2008 according to the report gupta had told goldman the month before his involvement became public that he wouldn t seek re election as a director in early 2011 with the delayed rajaratnam criminal trial about to begin the united states securities and exchange commission sec announced civil charges against gupta covering the berkshire investment as well as confidential quarterly earnings information from goldman and procter gamble p g gupta was board member at p g until voluntarily resigning the day of the sec announcement after the charges were announced gupta was an investor in some of the galleon hedge funds when he passed the information along and he had other business interests with rajaratnam that were potentially lucrative rajaratnam used the information from gupta to illegally profit in hedge fund trades the information on goldman made rajaratnam s funds 17 nbsp million richer the proctor gamble data created illegal profits of more than 570 000 for galleon funds managed by others the sec said gupta was said to have vigorously denied the sec accusations he is also a board member of amr corp gupta was convicted in june 2012 on insider trading charges stemming from raj rajaratnam galleon group anil kumar and rajat gupta insider trading cases galleon group case on insider trading conviction four criminal felony counts of conspiracy crime conspiracy and securities fraud he was sentenced in october 2012 to two years in prison an additional year on supervised release and ordered to pay 5 million in fines first quarter 2009 and december 2008 financial results in april 2009 there was controversy that goldman sachs had puffed up its q1 earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number a notification that was legal but some felt misleading the december loss also included a 850m writedown on loans to bankrupt chemical maker lyondellbasell as reported in late december the chemical maker formally declared bankruptcy on january 6 but the loan would have been marked to market it became clear in mid late december that lyondell would not be able to meet its debt obligations most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press bloomberg l p reuters etc aware of the accounting change and deteriorating market conditions into december were unsurprised by the december loss merrill lynch took at least 8 1b of losses in the same period however their lack of reaction and reporting of what was a widely expected result may have contributed to the surprise attributing this as a sign that the firm was trying to hide losses in december on the contrary the results of december 2008 were discussed up front and in detail by cfo david viniar in the first few minutes of the firm s q1 2009 conference call and were fully declared on page 10 of its earnings release document on april 22 2009 morgan stanley also reported a 1 3b net loss for the single month of december alongside a 177m loss for the first quarter jan mar however whereas goldman sachs first quarter earnings jan mar were well above forecasts which led to the speculation that the firm may have conveniently shifted losses into december morgan stanley s results for the same jan mar period were below consensus estimates this in addition to morgan stanley s losses in december would appear to support goldman s rejection of the notion that they deliberately shifted losses into december like goldman sachs morgan stanley converted to a bank holding company after the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in september 2008 at the end of 2009 the firm was on track to complete its most profitable year since its founding involvement with the bailout of aig american international group aig was bailed out by the us government in september 2008 after suffering a liquidity crisis whereby the federal reserve initially lent 85 nbsp billion to aig to allow the firm to meet its collateral and cash obligations in march 2009 it was reported that in 2008 goldman sachs alongside other major us and international financial institutions had received billions of dollars during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts purchased from aig including 12 9 billion from funds provided by the us federal reserve to bail out aig as of april 2009 us government loans to aig totaled over 180 nbsp billion the money was used to repay customers of its security lending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs may have benefited materially from the bailout and if they had been overpaid the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march 2009 that he was investigating whether aig s trading counterparties improperly received government money firm s response to criticism of aig payments goldman sachs has maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedge finance hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and 7 5 billion of collateral finance collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over 100m according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in q1 2009 rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the bank s trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldman s hedges against their aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of troubled asset relief program tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argues that cdss are mark to market marked to market i e valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aig s obligations against default rose substantially in the lead up to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral finance collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knock on defaults had aig been allowed to fail that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aig s fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg l p bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar has stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and then us treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed it is also a lesser known fact that morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise them on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldman s blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue a i g it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the a i g bailout media reports in may 2009 concerning friedman s involvement with goldman and in particular his purchase of the firm s stock when it traded at historical lows in the fourth quarter of 2008 fueled controversy and criticism over what was seen as a conflict of interest in friedman s new role as supervisor and regulator to goldman sachs these events prompted his resignation on may 7 2009 although friedman s purchases of goldman stock did not violate any fed rule statute or policy he said that the fed did not need this distraction he also stated his purchases made while approval of a waiver was pending were motivated by a desire to demonstrate confidence in the company during a time of market distress 60 million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages on may 10 2009 the goldman sachs group agreed to pay up to 60 million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney general s office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of 714 massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgage backed cdos during the boom in housing prices beginning in 2004 goldman sachs developed mortgage related securities known as synthetic cdo synthetic collateralized debt obligations cdos through april 2007 goldman issued over 20 of the cdos which it dubbed abacus for a total of 10 9 billion the securities performed very poorly and by april 2010 bloomberg reported that at least 5 billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted according to an article in the new york times goldman and one of its traders fabrice tourre were later sued by the sec over circumstances surrounding one of these cdos abacus 2007 ac1 tourre was found guilty of six of seven charges in august 2013 in a marketing presentation cds indexco was described as the owner of the dj cdx family of credit default swap cds indices formed from a merger of the major cds indices iboxx and trac x in april 2004 it introduced a second generation product such as index tranches and index options they launched the home equity abx he abx on 19 january 2006 advertised daily prices were availability on the markit website the purpose of the indices is to allow investors to trade exposures to the subprime market without holding the actual asset backed securities the abx he index was created from qualifying deals of 20 of the largest sub prime home equity abs shelf programs from the six month period preceding the roll the market makers of abx he were listed as goldman sachs jpmorgan chase jpmorgan deutsche bank barclays capital bank of america bnp paribas citigroup credit suisse lehman brothers merrill lynch rbs greenwich ubs and wachovia these investment firms had anticipated the crisis in 2006 wall street had introduced a new index called the abx that became a way to invest in the direction of mortgage securities the index allowed traders to bet on or against pools of mortgages with different risk characteristics just as stock indexes enable traders to bet on whether the overall stock market or technology stocks or bank stocks will go up or down according to a new york times article goldman sachs used an abx index to bet against i e short finance short the housing market in 2006 it also began marketing short bets using the abx index to hedge funds like john paulson hedge fund paulson company magnetar capital magnetar and soros fund management on july 15 2010 goldman settled agreeing to pay the sec 550 million the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about a complex financial security it originated a synthetic cdo called abacus 2007 ac1 the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing that paulson s interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with aca s when in reality paulson s interests were sharply conflicting the complaint states that paulson made a 1 nbsp billion profit from the short investments while purchasers of the materials lost the same amount the two main investors who lost money were abn amro bank n v abn amro and ikb deutsche industriebank on april 30 2010 shares tumbled further on news that the manhattan office of the us attorney general launched a criminal probe into goldman sachs sending the stock down nearly ten percent to 145 goldman issued a statement on the same day the suit was filed saying the sec s charges were unfounded in law and fact and giving specific reasons as to why the firm stated it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that the firm also lost money that aca selected the portfolio without the firm suggesting paulson was to be a long investor and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing 951 nbsp million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo goldman issued an additional public comment in response to the suit on april 19 2010 raising additional points while some have called these statements misleading others believe goldman has a strong defense or that the sec has a weak case experts on securities law contacted by the wall street journal believed the success or failure of the suit would depend on whether the facts not disclosed by goldman were material some such as duke university school of law duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit cox opined that goldman was aware of the relevance of paulson s involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school wayne state university law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson on july 15 2010 goldman agreed to pay 550 nbsp million 300 nbsp million to the u s government and 250 nbsp million to investors in a settlement with the sec the company did not admit or deny wrongdoing the company also agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments including the way it designs marketing materials the sec called the fine the largest commission penalty for a wall street firm the settlement does not cover tourre on april 14 2011 the united states senate s permanent subcommittee on investigations released a 635 page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the department of justice for further investigation on june 2 2011 following an exploratory meeting with the manhattan district attorney goldman was subpoenaed for relevant information goldman is expected to accept a deferred prosecution deferred prosecution agreement if charges are filed it was announced on august 9 2012 the united states department of justice decided not to file charges against goldman sachs over a 1 3 billion subprime mortgage portfolio goldman vice president fabrice tourre was sued by the sec over circumstances surrounding abacus 2007 ac1 tourre was unsuccessful in seeking a dismissal of the suit which went to trial jurors finding tourre guilty of six of seven charges including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal on august 1 2013 goldman sachs commodity index and the 2005 2008 food bubble goldman sachs creation of the s p gsci goldman sachs commodity index has been implicated by some in the 2007 2008 world food price crisis in a 2010 article in harper s magazine frederick kaufman argued that goldman s creation of the commodity index helped passive investors pension funds mutual funds and others enter the markets which disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand and price levels he argues that the result was a contango wheat market on the chicago mercantile exchange which caused prices of wheat to rise much higher than normal defeating the purpose of the exchanges price stabilization in the first place in a june 2010 article the economist defends goldman sachs by arguing that index tracking funds of which goldman sachs commodity index was one did not directly cause the bubble it describes a report by the organisation for economic co operation and development pointing out that commodities without futures markets also saw price rises during the period sale of dragon systems to lernout hauspie in 2000 goldman sachs advised dragon naturallyspeaking dragon systems on its sale to the belgian company lernout hauspie l h later collapsed due to accounting fraud jim and janet baker founders and together 50 owners of dragon filed a lawsuit against goldman sachs alleging that the firm did not warn dragon or the bakers of the accounting problems of the acquirer and that this led to the loss of their portion of the sale price of 580 million which was paid entirely in the form of the acquirer s stock on january 23 2013 a federal jury rejected the bakers claims and found goldman sachs not liable to the bakers for negligence intentional and negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty initial public offering kickback bribes documents under seal in a decade long lawsuit concerning etoys com s initial public offering ipo but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman sachs often involved asking for kickback bribery kickback bribes from their underwriting clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice taylor related civil and criminal cases fraud related to trading losses and concealment of futures positions in 2007 resulted in 1 5 million in penalties paid by the firm to regulators in 2012 the penalties were for not properly supervising trader matthew marshall taylor

bank of america dates back to 1904 when amadeo giannini founded the bank of italy usa bank of italy in san francisco the bank of italy served the needs of many immigrants settling in the united states at that time a service denied them by the existing american banks who were very discriminatory and denied service to all but the wealthiest the italian bank of italy was created in 1893 through the merger of 3 of the 6 banks at the time banca nazionale nel regno d italia and 2 tuscan banks giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather lorenzo scatena as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee when the 1906 san francisco earthquake struck giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires because san francisco s banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster from a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels he lent money to those who wished to rebuild later in life he took great pride in the fact that all of these loans were repaid in 1922 giannini established banca d america e d italia bank of america and italy 1986 deutsche bank ag acquires banca d america e d italia from bank of america corp in italy by buying banca dell italia meridionale in 1986 deutsche bank ag acquired 100 of banca d america e d italia a bank established in naples in 1917 following the name change of banca dell italia meridionale the latter established in 1918 in 1918 another corporation bancitaly corporation

countries on march 7 1927 giannini consolidated his bank of italy 101 branches with the newly formed liberty bank of america 175 branches the result was the bank of italy national trust savings association with capital of 30 nbsp million in 1928 a p giannini merged with bank of america los angeles and consolidated it with his other bank holdings to create what would become the largest banking institution in the country he renamed the bank of italy on november 3 1930 calling it bank of america the resulting company was headed by giannini with orra e monnette serving as co chair growth in california giannini sought to build a national bank expanding into most of the western states as well as into the insurance industry under the aegis of his holding company transamerica corporation in 1953 regulators succeeded in forcing the separation of transamerica corporation and bank of america under the clayton antitrust act the passage of the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited banks from owning non bank subsidiary non banking subsidiaries such as insurance companies bank of america and transamerica were separated with the latter company continuing in the insurance business however federal banking regulators prohibited bank of america s interstate banking activity and bank of america s domestic banks outside california were forced into a separate company that eventually became first interstate bancorp later acquired by wells fargo and company in 1996 it was not until the 1980s with a change in federal banking legislation and regulation that bank of america was again able to expand its domestic consumer banking activity outside california new technologies also allowed credit cards to be linked directly to individual bank accounts in 1958 the bank introduced the bankamericard which changed its name to visa credit card visa in 1975 a consortium of other california banks introduced master charge now mastercard to compete with bankamericard expansion outside california following the passage of the bank holding company act of 1956 bankamerica corporation was established for the purpose of owning and operation of bank of america and its subsidiaries bank of america expanded outside california in 1983 with its acquisition of seafirst corporation of seattle washington u s state washington and its wholly owned banking subsidiary seattle first national bank seafirst was at risk of seizure by the federal government after becoming insolvent due to a series of bad loans to the petroleum oil industry bankamerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as seafirst rather than bank of america until the 1998 merger with nationsbank bankamerica experienced huge losses in 1986 and 1987 by the placement of a series of bad loans in the third world particularly in latin america the company fired its ceo sam armacost though armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor alden w clausen a w tom clausen clausen was appointed to replace armacost the losses resulted in a huge decline of bankamerica stock making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover first interstate bancorp of los angeles which had originated from banks once owned by bankamerica launched such a bid in the fall of 1986 although bankamerica rebuffed it mostly by selling operations it sold its financeamerica subsidiary to chrysler and the brokerage firm charles schwab corporation charles schwab and co back to charles r schwab mr schwab it also sold bank of america and italy to deutsche bank by the time of the black monday 1987 1987

which security pacific had acquired in a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s this was at the time the largest bank acquisition in history federal regulators however forced the sale of roughly half of security pacific s washington subsidiary the former rainier bank as the combination of seafirst and security pacific washington would have given bankamerica too large a share of the market in that state the washington branches were divided and sold to west one bancorp now u s bancorp and keybank later that year bankamerica expanded into nevada by acquiring valley bank of nevada in 1994 bankamerica acquired the continental illinois national bank and trust co of chicago which had become federally owned as part of the same oil industry debacle emanating from oklahoma city s penn square bank that had brought down numerous financial institutions including seafirst at the time no bank possessed the resources to bail out continental so the federal government operated the bank for nearly a decade illinois at that time regulated branch banking extremely heavily so bank of america illinois was a single unit bank until the 21st century bankamerica moved its national lending department to chicago in an effort to establish a financial beachhead in the region these mergers helped bankamerica corporation to once again become the largest u s bank holding company in terms of deposits but the company fell to second place in 1997 behind fast growing nationsbank corporation and to third in 1998 behind north carolina s first union corp on the capital markets side the acquisition of

pay up to 5 8 nbsp billion of bonuses at merrill the bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the merrill acquisition in december 2008 the issue was originally investigated by new york state attorney general andrew cuomo who commented after the suit and announced settlement that the timing of the bonuses as well as the disclosures relating to them constituted a surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility and our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to new york s martin act will continue congressman kucinich commented at the same time that this may not be the last fine that bank of america pays for how it handled its merger of merrill lynch a federal judge jed rakoff in an unusual action refused to approve the settlement on august 5 a first hearing before the judge on august 10 was at times heated and he was sharply critical of the bonuses david rosenfeld represented the sec and lewis j liman son of arthur l liman represented the bank the actual amount of bonuses paid was 3 6 nbsp billion of which 850 nbsp million was guaranteed and the rest was shared amongst 39 000 workers who received average payments of 91 000 696 people received more than 1 nbsp million in bonuses at least one person received a more than 33 nbsp million bonus on september 14 the judge rejected the settlement and told the parties to prepare for trial to begin no later than february 1 2010 the judge focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the bank s shareholders who were the ones that were supposed to have been injured by the lack of disclosure he wrote it is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims money should be used to make the case against the management go away the proposed settlement the judge continued suggests a rather cynical relationship between the parties the s e c gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the bank of america in a high profile merger the bank s management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators and all this is done at the expense not only of the shareholders but also of the truth investigations also were held on this issue in the united states house committee on oversight and government reform under chairman edolphus towns d ny and in its investigative united states house oversight and government reform subcommittee on domestic policy domestic policy subcommittee under kucinich fraud in 2010 the bank was accused by the u s government of defrauding schools hospitals and dozens of state and local government

providing employees with recognition awards which can be exchanged for merchandise or gift cards or employees can receive appreciation points which can accumulate for future redemption these incentives are only for entry level to mid level employees these career incentives provide evidence for bureaucratic control within the company all employees receive life management benefits such as tuition reimbursement child care benefits and an employee assistance program which provides confidential services for families and health care including medical dental and vision benefits bank of america bases itself on a pay for performance culture and therefore they have a rewards program in place to reward employees for contributing to the success of the company at the senior level compensation is heavily oriented towards long term incentive plans which vest over a multi year period encouraging managers to both stay at the company as well as focus on long term as opposed to short term profitability at the lower level the long term incentives are a smaller percentage of overall compensation but the company still provides long term incentives for all employees for example

jobs available within bank of america coaching and global learning programs bank of america has an employee learning curriculum where employees can take thousands of different courses with tuition reimbursement this allows employees to further their skills in current positions and also provides the opportunity to advance into other jobs this further provides evidence of bureaucratic control

shareholders not only is his physical presence seen throughout the company but he also writes letters to clients shareholders and on manuals such as the code of ethics which can motivate people to trust him to manage the company well and to work hard for him he is also seen throughout the world of finance as a nice boss and one that is trying to prove to the world that he is capable of fixing the problems that arose in the past five years bank of america also expresses its commitment to ensuring that its suppliers use responsible practices and goes as far as surveying suppliers to assess their performance and practices bank of america also commits itself to using local economies in order to be environmental and help boost local businesses due to the team focus diversity and job autonomy there seems to be a lot of high commitment work practices within the bank of america workforce although there is a hierarchy there does appear to be the ability to move up in the workforce and the ceo works as a team with officers below him incentives are also used to ensure people are contributing to the success of the company and want to stay with bank of america for many years these practices encourage creativity and commitment from the employees to the company and are a product of bureaucratic control corporate affairs board of directors as of 2011 03 16 pending addition at

globalsign go daddy and others history 1982 to 1989 founded in 1982 by gary hendrix with a national science foundation grant symantec was originally focused on artificial intelligence related projects including a database program hendrix hired several stanford university natural language processing researchers as the company s first employees among them barry greenstein professional poker player and developer of the word processor component within q a software q a in 1984 it became clear that the advanced natural language and database system that symantec had developed could not be ported from dec minicomputers to the pc this left symantec without a product but with expertise in natural language database query systems and technology as a result later in 1984 symantec was acquired by another smaller software startup company c e software founded by denis coleman and gordon eubanks and headed by eubanks c e software was in the process of developing an integrated file management and word processing program the merged company retained the name symantec and eubanks became its chairman vern raburn the former ceo of the original symantec remained as ceo of the combined company soon after the merger eubanks and raburn recruited rod turner into symantec as its executive vice president for marketing sales product management and international business turner had been in interviews and discussions with c e software in early 1984 about becoming the president of c e these discussions had ended when the two companies merged the new symantec combined the file management and word processing functionality that c e had planned and added an advanced natural language query system designed by gary hendrix and engineered by dan gordon that set new standards for ease of database query and report generation the natural language system was named the intelligent assistant turner chose the name of q a for symantec s flagship product in large part because the name lent itself to use in a short easily merchandised logo brett walter designed the user interface of q a brett walter director of product management q a software q a was released in november 1985 during 1986 vern raburn and gordon eubanks swapped roles and eubanks became ceo and president of symantec while raburn became its chairman subsequent to this change raburn had little involvement with symantec and in a few years time eubanks added the chairmanship to his other roles after a slow start for sales of q a in the fall of 1985 and spring of 1986 turner signed up a new advertising agency called elliot dickens embarked on an aggressive new advertising campaign and came up with the six pack program in which all symantec employees regardless of role went on the road training and selling dealer sales staff nationwide in the united states turner named it six pack because employees were to work six days a week see six dealerships per day train six sales representatives per store and stay with friends free or at motel 6 simultaneously a promotion was run jointly with sofsell which was symantec s exclusive wholesale distributor in the united states for the first year that q a was on the market this promotion was very successful in encouraging dealers to try q a file symantec headquarters mountain view jpg thumb left symantec headquarters in mountain view california 2013 during this time symantec was advised by jim lally and john doerr nbsp both were board members of symantec at that stage nbsp kleiner perkins caufield byers that if symantec would cut its expenses and grow revenues enough to achieve cash flow break even then kpcb would back the company in raising more venture capital to accomplish this the management team worked out a salary reduction schedule where the chairman and the ceo would take zero pay all vice presidents would take a 50 pay cut and all other employees pay was cut by 15 two employees were laid off eubanks also negotiated a sizable rent reduction on the office space the company had leased in the days of the original symantec these expense reductions combined with strong international sales of q a enabled the company to attain break even because all team members were sharing in the suffering of reduced income and because of the unifying affects of the six pack program symantec s morale during this period was very high nbsp the more so when one considers that the company had a very uncertain future at this time the significantly increased traction for q a from this re launch grew symantec s revenues substantially along with early success for q a in international markets uniquely a german version was shipped three weeks after the united states version and it was the first software in the world that supported german natural language following turner s having placed emphasis on establishing international sales distribution and multiple language versions of q a from initial shipment in 1985 rod turner negotiated the publishing agreement with david whitney for symantec s second product which turner named noteit an annotation utility for lotus 1 2 3 it was evident to turner that noteit would confuse the dealer channel if it was launched under the symantec name because symantec had built up interest by that stage in q a but not yet shipped it and because the low price point for the utility would not be initially attractive to the dealer channel until demand had been built up turner felt that the product should be marketed under a unique brand name turner and gordon eubanks gordon e eubanks jr then chairman of symantec corporation agreed to form a new division of symantec and eubanks delegated the choice of name to turner turner chose the name turner hall publishing to be a new division of symantec devoted to publishing third party software and hardware the objective of the division was to diversify revenues and accelerate the growth of symantec turner chose the name turner hall publishing using his last name and that of dottie hall director of marketing communications in order to convey the sense of a stable long established company turner hall publishing s first offering was note it a notation utility add in for lotus 1 2 3 which was developed by david whitney and licensed to symantec its second product was the turner hall card which was a 256k ram half slot memory card initially made to inexpensively increase the available memory for symantec s then flagship product q a the turner hall division also marketed the card as a standalone product turner hall s third product also a 1 2 3 add in was synex systems corporation sqz sqz a lotus 1 2 3 spreadsheet compression utility developed by chris graham synex systems corporation synex systems in the summer of 1986 eubanks and turner recruited tom byers from digital research to expand the turner hall publishing product family and lead the turner hall effort by the winter of 1986 87 the turner hall publishing division had achieved success with noteit the turner hall card and sqz the popularity of these products while contributing a relatively small portion of revenues to symantec conveyed the impression that symantec was already a diversified company and indeed many industry participants were under the impression that symantec had acquired turner hall publishing in 1987 byers recruited ted schlein into the turner hall product group to assist in building the product family and in marketing revenues from q a and from symantec s early launch into the international marketplace combined with turner hall publishing generated the market presence and scale that enabled symantec to make its first merger acquisition in february 1987 that of breakthrough software maker of the timeline project management software for dos because this was the first time that symantec had acquired a business that had revenues inventory and customers eubanks chose to change nothing at breakthrough software for six months and the actual merger logistics started in the summer of 1987 with turner being appointed by eubanks as general manager of the timeline business unit turner was made responsible for the successful integration of the company into symantec and ongoing growth of the business with p l there was a heavy emphasis placed on making the minimum disruption by eubanks and turner soon after the acquisition of timeline breakthrough software eubanks reorganized symantec structuring the company around product centric groups each having its own development quality assurance technical support and product marketing functions and a general manager with profit and loss responsibility sales finance and operations were centralized functions that were shared this structure lent itself well to symantec s further growth through mergers and acquisitions eubanks made turner general manager of the new timeline product group and simultaneously of the q a product group and made tom byers general manager of the turner hall product group turner continued to build and lead the company s international business and marketing for the whole company at the timeline product group turner drove strong marketing promotion and sales programs in order to accelerate momentum by 1989 this merger was very successful product group morale was high timeline development continued apace and the increased sales and marketing efforts applied built the timeline into the clear market lead in pc project management software on dos both the q a and timeline product groups were healthily profitable the profit stream and merger success set the stage for subsequent merger and acquisition activity by the company and indeed funded the losses of some of the product groups that were subsequently acquired 2000 to

kroger branded grocery stores are located throughout the midwestern and southern united states kroger also is parent to several banner chains such as ralphs in california kroger s employees are mostly represented by collective bargaining agreements seventy five percent of kroger employees are represented by the united food and commercial workers ufcw history beginning in 1883 bernard kroger bernard barney kroger invested his life savings of 372 roughly equal to today to open a grocery store in the mount airy cincinnati mount airy neighborhood of cincinnati kroger was the son of a merchant and his slogan was simple be particular never sell anything you would not want yourself kroger tried many ways to satisfy customers he tried to make his own products such as bread so that customers would not need to go to a separate bakery in 1929 there were rumors of a safeway inc safeway kroger merger in the 1930s kroger was the first grocery chain to monitor product quality and test foods offered to customers and also the first to have a store surrounded on all four sides by parking lots 1940s 1970s in the mid 1950s kroger entered the houston texas market by acquiring the houston based chain henke pillot nearly around the same time kroger acquired krambo of the milwaukee wisconsin area and child s the stores were eventually converted to the kroger banner in the mid 1960s kroger exited milwaukee in the 1970s speculation occurred that it would return to milwaukee in 2008 when roundy s was rumored to be for sale but it never happened kroger opened stores in florida under the superx and florida choice banners from the 1960s until 1986 when the chain decided to exit the state and sold all of its stores sweetbay supermarket kash n karry bought the largest share recently retail analysts have begun to speculate about whether kroger may capitalize on the misfortunes of albertsons and food lion and re enter florida again in the 1970s kroger became the first grocer in america to test an electronic scanner and the first to formalize consumer research although kroger has long operated stores in the huntsville alabama huntsville decatur alabama decatur area of northern alabama as a southern extension of its nashville tennessee region it has not operated in the state s largest market birmingham alabama birmingham since the early 1970s when it exited as a result of intense competition from winn dixie and local chains bruno s supermarkets and western supermarkets kroger entered the charlotte north carolina charlotte market in 1977 and expanded rapidly throughout the 1980s when it bought some stores from bi lo united states bi lo however most stores were in less desirable neighborhoods and did not fit in with kroger s upscale image less than three months after bi lo pulled out that company decided to re enter the charlotte market and in 1988 kroger announced it would leave the charlotte market and put its stores up for sale in an ironic twist bi lo united states bi lo bought kroger s remaining stores in the charlotte area 1980s kroger opened a number of stores in the western pennsylvania region encompassing pittsburgh and surrounding areas until the early 1980s when the u s began experiencing a severe economic early 1980s recession recession the recession had two significant and related effects on kroger s operations in the region first the highly cyclical manufacturing based economy of the region declined in greater proportion than the rest of the u s which undercut demand for the higher end products and services offered by kroger the second effect of the economic recession was to worsen labor management relations which led to a protracted labor strike in 1983 and 1984 during the strike kroger withdrew all of its stores from the western pennsylvania market including some recently opened superstores and greenhouses the new superstores in western pennsylvania which included at least the one at north huntingdon township westmoreland county pennsylvania north huntingdon township irwin pa and another at cranberry township were kroger s state of the art facilities they were equipped with optical bar code check out scanners that were new to the industry and especially to the region in addition to the usual meat dairy produce departments they contained a separate bakery deli cheese shop and seafood counter amenities that have come to define the modern suburban grocery store in an innovation that did not define future trends the new superstores also included extensive non foods departments that sold among other things televisions and other electronics hence the closure of these newly opened trend setting facilities represented an abrupt retreat in the region kroger s exit ceded the market to lower cost locally owned rivals most notably giant eagle and the supervalu united states supervalu supplied shop n save pittsburgh shop n save and foodland chains ironically kroger bought eagle grocery company whose founders went on to create giant eagle kroger still maintains a presence in the nearby morgantown west virginia wheeling west virginia and weirton west virginia steubenville ohio

other supermarket with any market overlap kroger entered the competitive san antonio texas market in 1980 but pulled out in mid 1993 on june 15 1993 the company announced it would close its 15 area stores 60 days later the chain closed several stores around flint michigan in 1981 which were converted by local businessman al kessel to a new chain called kessel food markets kroger bought most of these stores back in 1999 and began reverting them several other michigan stores were sold to another flint based chain hamady brothers in 1980 the hamady acquisition was short lived in 1983 the

1980s when that plant shut down kroger closed its northeastern ohio stores in the cleveland akron ohio akron and youngstown ohio youngstown areas some of those former kroger stores were taken over by stores like acme fresh markets giant eagle and heinens kroger opened and had about 50 stores in st louis missouri st louis until it left the market in 1986 saying that its stores were unprofitable most of its stores were bought by national supermarkets national schnucks and shop n save safeway inc safeway excluding the randall s food markets randalls chain exited the houston market in early 1988 it sold many of its own properties to kroger the market leader in the region which is still followed by randalls now owned by safeway today kroger also experienced a similar withdrawal from chattanooga tennessee in 1989 many of these stores were sold to the local grocery chain red food which was in turn bought by bi lo united states bi lo in 1994 today chattanooga is the only metropolitan market in tennessee in which kroger does not operate 1990s and beyond in 1997 kroger merged with the then fifth largest grocery company fred meyer along with its subsidiaries ralphs qfc

operators of automated teller machines more specifically it is alleged that mastercard s and visa s network rules prohibit atm operators from offering lower prices for transactions over pin debit networks that are not affiliated with visa or mastercard the suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using atms limits the revenue that atm operators earn and violates the sherman act sherman act s prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade johnathan rubin an attorney for the plaintiffs said visa and mastercard are the ringleaders organizers and

practices employed by mastercard and visa a majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement stephen neuwirth a lawyer representing home depot said it s so obvious visa and mastercard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given it s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the home depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis point reduction 0 1 percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months this eight month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013 the total value of the settlement will be about 7 25 billion the settlement lowers interchange fees for merchants and also protects credit card companies

the european payment system as of 2013 mastercard is under investigation by the european union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in europe and other anti competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade and high fees associated with premium credit cards the eu s competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non cash payments mastercard charges non european tourists much more than customers using cards issued in europe mastercard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around 740 million mastercard was banned from charging fees on cross border transactions conducted wholly within the eu via a ruling by the european commission in 2007 the european commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders for instance a 50 euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the netherlands but eight times that amount in

nations high commissioner for human rights high commissioner for human rights navi pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to wikileaks could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information thus potentially violating wikileaks right to freedom of expression the company that enables wikileaks to accept credit and debit card donations said it would take legal action against visa europe and mastercard iceland based it firm datacell said it would move immediately to try to force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website datacell had earlier said that suspension of payments towards wikileaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers on july 14 2011 datacell announced they had filed a complaint with the european

states bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a shop in grand detour in 1837 which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels what was more successful than these small tools was deere s cast steel plough plow which was pioneered in 1837 prior to deere s introduction of the steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows which stuck to the rich midwestern soil and had to be cleaned very frequently the smooth sided steel plow solved this problem and would greatly aid migration into the american great plains in the 19th and early 20th century deere s production of plows began slowly but increased greatly when he departed from the traditional business model of making equipment as it was ordered and instead began to manufacture plows before they were ordered and then put them up for sale this allowed customers to see what they were buying beforehand and word of the product began to spread quickly in 1842 deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new two story factory along the rock river mississippi river rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about 100 plows in 1842 and approximately 400 plows during the next year despite the success deere s partnership with andrus ended in 1848 when deere relocated to moline illinois in order to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river in moline deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and quickly built a new factory in 1848 production at the plant rose quickly and by 1849 the deere tate gould company was producing over 200 plows a month and a two story addition to the plant was built to allow for further production john deere bought out tate and gould s interests in the company in 1853 the same year that he was joined in the business by his son charles deere the business continued to expand until 1857 when the company s production totals reached almost 1 120 implements per month then in 1858 a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company in order to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his son in law christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his father s managerial roles the company was reorganized one final time in 1868 when it was incorporated as deere company the company s original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere who would serve as president of the company until 1886 despite this it was charles who effectively ran the company in 1869 charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the company s sales nationwide john deere died in 1886 and the presidency of deere company passed to charles deere by now the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators the company even expanded into the bicycle business briefly during the 1890s but the core focus of the company

1900s decade 1900s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but it was the production of gasoline tractors which would come to define deere company s operations during the twentieth century in 1912 deere company president william butterworth businessman william butterworth who had replaced charles deere after his death in 1907 began the company s expansion into the tractor business deere company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain all wheel drive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in 1918 which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo

interior costco focuses on selling products at low prices often at very high volume these goods are usually bulk packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell typically under the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a single vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november 16 2009 costco announced that it would stop selling coca cola products because the soft drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling coca cola products on december 14 2009 costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must bring their own bags or use the merchandise shipping boxes from the company s outside vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is

success corporate identity logo ref according to steve jobs apple was so named because jobs was coming back from an apple farm and he was on a fruitarian diet he thought the name was fun spirited and not intimidating apple s first logo designed by ron wayne depicts sir isaac newton sitting under an apple tree it was almost immediately replaced by rob janoff s rainbow apple the now familiar rainbow colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it janoff presented jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the bitten logo and jobs immediately took a liking to it while jobs liked the logo he insisted it be in color to humanize the company the logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry the colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible and to represent the fact the apple ii could generate graphics in color both janoff and apple deny any homage to turing in the design of the logo on august 27 1999 but apple inc had trademark issues with apple corps apple corps ltd a multimedia company started by the beatles in 1967 involving their name and logo this resulted in a apple corps v apple computer series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies these issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007 advertising apple s first slogan byte into an apple was coined in the late 1970s from 1997

efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products though its apple inc advertising criticism advertising was criticized for the claims made by some later campaigns particularly the 2005 power mac ads and iphone ads in britain apple s product commercials gained fame for launching musicians into stardom as a result of their eye popping graphics and catchy tunes first the company popularized canadian singer feist singer feist s 1234 song 1234 song in its ad campaign apple s brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product at one time apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established apple evangelist guy kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism something that was stumbled upon apple has however supported the continuing existence of a network of macintosh user group mac user groups in most major and many minor centers of population where mac computers are available mac users would meet at the european apple expo and the san francisco macworld conference expo trade shows where apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until apple pulled out of both events while the conferences continue apple does not have official representation there mac developers in turn continue to gather at the annual apple worldwide developers conference apple store openings can draw crowds of thousands with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event the new york city fifth avenue cube store had a line as long as half a mile a few mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage the ginza opening in tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks john sculley told the guardian newspaper in 1997 people talk about technology but apple was a marketing company it was the marketing company of the decade research in 2002 by nielsen online netratings indicate that the average apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other pc company consumers the research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average apple inc products are more expensive than other pc products corporate affairs during the mac s early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with apple s adoption of the peripheral component interconnect pci bus in the power macintosh 7500 7500 power macintosh 8500 8500 power macintosh 9500 9500 power macintosh power macs apple has since adopted usb agp hypertransport wi fi and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a

store opened apple has sold third party accessories for instance at one point nikon and canon company canon digital cameras were sold inside the store adobe software adobe one of apple s oldest software partners also sells its mac compatible software as does microsoft who sells microsoft office for the mac books from john wiley sons who publishes the for dummies series of instructional books

after the launch of the ibookstore apple stopped selling physical books both online and at the apple retail stores headquarters apple inc s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of silicon valley at 1 6 infinite loop street infinite loop cupertino california cupertino california this apple campus has six buildings that total and was built in 1993 by sobrato development cos in

bring the total workforce from around 2 800 to 3 300 employees the company will build a new office block on its hollyhill campus to accommodate the additional staff corporate culture apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a corporate culture should look like in organizational hierarchy flat versus tall casual versus formal attire etc other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include southwest airlines and microsoft originally the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like ibm by default thanks to the influence of its founders steve jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple was a fortune 500 company by the time of the 1984 television commercial 1984 tv ad this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors according to a 2011 report in fortune magazine fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives each with his own idea of what apple should be some of its original character has arguably been lost but apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ this was especially after jobs s return to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman numerous employees of apple have cited that projects without jobs s involvement often took longer than projects with his involvement at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having best in class employees in every role for instance ron johnson businessman ron johnson who was senior vice president of retail operations until november 1 2011 was responsible for site selection in store service and store layout yet he had no control of the inventory in his stores which is done company wide by then coo and now ceo tim cook who has a background in supply chain management this is the opposite of general electric s corporate culture which has created well rounded managers the company previously advertised its products as being made in america up to the late 1990s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s almost all of its manufacturing is now done abroad according to a report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that made in the u s a is no longer a viable option for most apple products unlike other major us companies apple has a relatively simple compensation policy for executives which does not include perks that other ceos enjoy such as country club fees and private use of company aircraft the company usually grants stock options to executives every other year a media article published in july 2013 provided details about apple s at home apple advisors customer support program that serves as the corporation s call center the advisors are employed within the u s and work remotely after undergoing a four week training program that also serves as a testing period the advisors earn between us 9 and 12 per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support employee relations a class action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation has been filed against apple in a california federal district court litigation apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation and like its competitors and peers engages in litigation trying legal cases before the courts in its normal course of business for a variety of

the 1980s apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low tax subsidiaries on other

inc apple subsequently developed a competing standard truetype which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font s outlines and licensed it to microsoft adobe responded by publishing the type 1 specification and releasing adobe type manager software that allowed wysiwyg scaling of type 1 fonts on screen like truetype although without the precise pixel level control but these moves were too late to stop the rise of truetype although type 1 remained the standard in the graphics publishing market truetype became the standard for business and the average windows user in 1996 adobe and microsoft announced the opentype font format and in 2003 adobe completed converting its type 1 font library to opentype in the mid 1980s adobe entered the consumer computer software software market with adobe illustrator a vector graphics vector based drawing program for the apple macintosh illustrator which grew from the firm s in house font development software helped popularize postscript enabled laser printers unlike macdraw the then standard macintosh vector drawing program illustrator described shapes with more flexible b zier curves

creative suite offering in a failure to predict the direction of computing adobe released a complete version of illustrator for steve jobs ill fated next system but a poorly produced version for

pricing adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being as much as twice as high in non us countries as in the us as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobe s software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite 3 master collection which was 1 000 higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by 10 000 users in june 2009 adobe further increased its prices in the uk by 10 in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar and uk users are not allowed to buy from the us store in 2011 after the company announced that it will only allow owners of the most recent versions of creative suite to upgrade to new versions scott kelby the president of the national association of photoshop professionals wrote an open letter to adobe requesting it re thinks its product upgrade policy customer service the company has been criticized by users for bad customer service in august 2009 adobe apologized on their main support web page for poor customer service security and stability for years hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobe s flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see flash player criticism criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs5 adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe s software has been criticized for among other things slow performance and frequent crashes marketing ethics adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software third party browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the adobe flash flash update process and for pushing a third party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs criticism of creative cloud adobe has caused concerns within the photography and filmmaking community especially long term users in may 2013 adobe systems announced plans to end perpetual software licensing for its adobe creative suite creative suite products in favor of a subscription based service model called creative cloud which had been introduced as an alternative licensing model in may 2012 shifting to a software as a service model adobe announced more frequent feature updates to its products and the eschewing of their traditional release cycles customers must pay a monthly subscription fee and if they stop paying they will lose access to the software as well as to the work they saved in proprietary format proprietary file format which is not backward compatible with the creative suite adobe admitted that this is a valid concern in addition they will not be able to retrieve their files from the cloud once the subscription has expired they must have internet connection to download the software and to use the 2 gb of provided storage space or the additionally purchased 20 gb and must validate the license monthly although investors applauded the move the reaction across segments of adobe s user base was swift this shift has been met with mixed reviews by both corporations and independent designers with many people expressing their displeasure on the web and through multiple internet petitions calling upon adobe to continue selling creative software under the perpetual licensing model among these was a change org petition which reached over 30 000 signatures within a few weeks of the announcement currently as of january 21 2014 at 46 300 according to the critics the move to a perpetual rental scheme was highly disruptive to many users and caused an unprecedented loss of trust in adobe as a company and an attendant rise in anxiety among their customers users noted that they have not always wanted nor could they afford to upgrade to the newest versions of the software and the new licensing was essentially forcing them to do this college officials expressed their concern with the new licensing terms worried about rising costs and have asked about switching to alternative products adobe vp of creative solutions responded that they expected a higher degree of this type of reaction from the hobbyist photographic community despite a storm of customer criticism over adobe s move to subscription only pricing the company announced that it would not sell perpetual licenses to its software alongside the subscriptions we understand this is a big change but we are so focused on the vision we shared for creative cloud and we plan to focus all our new innovation on the creative cloud digital photography review wrote that the new license scheme increased fear uncertainty and doubt fear uncertainty doubt expense and risk

clone adobe however claimed that creative cloud is its highest customer satisfaction product in the creative space and that even prior to adobe s move to a pure subscription model more than 80 percent of customers who bought products from adobe s web site picked cc over cs creative cloud has been criticized for broken file syncing one of its core features in may 2013 adobe announced that it was suspending the file sync desktop preview for the next couple of weeks and were far from convinced by adobe s subscription model users were concerned that they would be forced to upgrade their computer hardware when it is no longer supported by the current version of the creative cloud software although creative cloud was expected to end the software piracy piracy of adobe photoshop photoshop which is one of the most pirated pieces of software creative cloud was hacked and its applications made illegally available a day after it officially launched however adobe claims that creative cloud will be more accessible and provide better value we believe in fighting piracy of software by making the right software for the right people at the right price the service has been criticized for its price which is higher in europe than in the us and according to adobe is based on customer research that assesses the value of the product in the local market critics noted that adobe lists 29 supported currencies whereas boxed versions could be installed in any of the world s 249 territories without issue current users of creative suite 3 and higher get discounts for the creative cloud service for a limited time after which the subscription cost increases creative cloud has also been criticized for its terms of use a license agreement that according to the critics raises issues with internet privacy privacy predictability and fairness for the customer users worried about the cloud computing security security implications of putting their assets to the cloud source code and customer data breach on october 3 2013 the company initially revealed that 2 9 million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe

make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted a 3 8 gb file stolen from adobe and containing 152 million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnews org lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed

information with very little effort facebook and evernote began notifying their users who used the same email addresses for their accounts as those compromised in the adobe breach according to an it expert adobe has failed its customers and should hang their heads in shame many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud software by subscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for non us customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based ten weeks after the attack was discovered adobe said that it was taking longer than expected to warn customers about the massive data breach leaving some in the dark a class action lawsuit has been filed against adobe for failing to safeguard the login credentials and financial information of consumers who used adobe s creative cloud service in this case it is alleged that adobe requires many of its consumers to keep active credit and debit card numbers on file but did not safeguard them from hackers experts cited in the lawsuit claim there will be future breaches by hackers resulting from adobe s shoddy security protocols and reliance on a software as a service system because hacker computer security hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary software proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected adobe acrobat acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobe s expensive products according to hold security a firm which discovered 40 gb of adobe s source code on a server of a russian speaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero day attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswire s customers which has been tied to the adobe security breach they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state

moore and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of andrew grove intel combines advanced chip design capability with a leading edge manufacturing capability though intel was originally known primarily to engineers and technologists its intel inside advertising campaign of the 1990s made it a household name along with its pentium processors intel was an early developer of static random access memory sram and dynamic random access memory dram memory chips and this represented the majority of its business until 1981 although intel created the world s first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971 it was not until the success of the personal computer pc that this became its primary business during the 1990s intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry during this period intel became the market dominance dominant supplier of microprocessors for pcs and was known for aggressive and sometimes illegal tactics in defense of its market position particularly against advanced micro devices amd as well as a struggle with microsoft for control over the direction of the pc industry the 2013 rankings of the world s 100 most valuable brands published by millward brown optimor showed the company s brand value at number 61 intel has also begun research into electrical transmission and generation intel

wikt homophone homophone for more noise an ill suited name for an electronics company since electronic noise noise in electronics is usually very undesirable and typically associated with bad electromagnetic interference interference instead they used the name nm electronics for almost a year before deciding to call their company int egrated el ectronics or intel for short since intel was already trademarked by the hotel chain intelco they had to buy the rights for the name early history at its founding intel was distinguished by its ability to make semiconductors its first product in 1969 was the 3101 schottky transistor schottky ttl bipolar junction transistor bipolar 64 bit static random access memory sram which was nearly twice as fast as earlier schottky diode implementations by fairchild and the electrotechnical laboratory in tsukuba ibaraki tsukuba japan in the same year intel also produced the 3301 schottky bipolar 1024 bit read only memory rom and the first commercial

who helped intel become a microprocessor company jpg thumb 200px federico faggin the designer of intel 4004 while intel created the intel 4004 first commercially available microprocessor intel 4004 in 1971 by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random access memory chips however increased competition from japanese semiconductor manufacturers had by 1983 dramatically reduced the profitability of this market and the sudden success of the ibm personal computer convinced then ceo andrew grove to shift the company s focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model by the end of the 1980s this decision had proven successful buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to ibm and ibm s competitors within the rapidly growing ibm pc compatible personal computer market intel embarked on a 10 year period of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the pc industry by launching its intel inside marketing campaign in 1989 intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection so that by the end of the 1990s its line of pentium brand pentium processors had become a household name slowing demand and challenges to dominance after 2000 growth in demand for high end microprocessors slowed competitors notably amd intel s largest competitor in its primary x86 x86 architecture market garnered significant market share initially in low end and mid range processors but ultimately across the product range and intel s dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced in the early 2000s then ceo craig barrett businessman craig barrett attempted to diversify the company s business beyond semiconductors but few of these activities were ultimately successful intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation us law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology circuit layouts until the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 a law sought by intel and the semiconductor industry association sia during the late 1980s and 1990s after this law was passed intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the intel 80386 80386 cpu the lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills even if intel lost the suits the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field in 2008 intel had another tick when it introduced the penryn microarchitecture which was 45 nbsp nm later that year intel released a processor with the nehalem microarchitecture nehalem architecture nehalem had positive reviews sale of xscale processor business on june 27 2006 the sale of intel s xscale assets was announced intel agreed to sell the xscale processor business to marvell technology group for an estimated 600 nbsp million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities the move was intended to permit intel to focus its resources on its core x86 and server businesses and the mergers and acquisitions acquisition completed on november 9 2006 acquisitions on august 19 2010 intel announced that it planned to purchase mcafee a manufacturer of computer security technology the purchase price was 7 68 nbsp billion and the companies said that if the deal were approved new products would be released early in 2011 on january 26 2011 the european union approved the acquisition after intel agreed to provide rival security firms with all necessary information that would allow their products to use intel s chips and personal computers after the acquisition intel had about 90 000 employees including about 12 000 software engineers on august 30 2010 intel and infineon technologies

s smartphone tablet and wireless efforts and will be headed by hermann eul and mike bell opening up the foundries finding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the ultrabook to gain market traction and with pc sales declining in 2013 intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for altera using 14 nm process general manager of intel s custom foundry division sunit rikhi indicated that intel would pursue further such deals in the future this was after poor sales of windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers except for qualcomm which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer apple as of july 2013 five companies will use intel s fabs via the intel custom foundry division achronix tabula company tabula netronome microsemi and altera most are fpga makers but netronome designs network processors only achronix began shipping chips made by intel using the 22 nm tri gate process several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time the alliance for affordable internet a4ai was launched in october 2013 and intel is part of the coalition of public and private organisations

the microprocessor intel s first products were shift register memory and random access primary storage memory integrated circuits and intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive dynamic random access memory dram static random access memory sram and read only memory rom markets throughout the 1970s concurrently intel engineers marcian hoff federico faggin stanley mazor and masatoshi shima invented intel s first microprocessor originally developed for the japanese company busicom to replace a number of application specific integrated circuit asics in a calculator already produced by busicom the intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on november 15 1971 though the microprocessor did not become the core of intel s business until the mid 1980s note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almost simultaneous invention of the microprocessor from dram to microprocessors in 1983 at the dawn of the personal computer era intel s profits came under increased pressure from japanese memory chip manufacturers and then president andy grove focused the company on microprocessors grove described this transition in the book only the paranoid survive a key element of his plan was the notion then considered radical of becoming the single source for successors to the popular intel 8086 8086 microprocessor until then the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier but grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as zilog and advanced micro devices amd when the pc industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s intel was one of the primary beneficiaries intel x86 processors and the ibm

eprom and input output i o in the same chip despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor the intel 4004 4004 and its successors the intel 8008 8008 and the intel 8080 8080 were never major revenue contributors at intel as the next processor the 8086 and its variant the 8088 was completed in 1978 intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed operation crush and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible one design win was the newly created ibm pc division though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time ibm introduced its personal computer in 1981 and it was rapidly successful in 1982 intel created the intel 80286 80286 microprocessor which two years later was used in the ibm pc at compaq the first ibm pc clone manufacturer produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first intel 80386 80386 based system beating ibm and establishing a competitive market for pc compatible systems and setting up intel as a key component supplier in 1975 the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32 bit microprocessor finally released in 1981 as the intel iapx 432 the project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives and it failed in the marketplace intel extended the x86 x86 architecture to 32 bits instead 386 microprocessor during this period andrew grove dramatically redirected the company closing much of its dram business and directing resources to the microprocessor business of perhaps greater importance was his decision to single source the 386 microprocessor prior to this microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production interrupting supplies to customers to mitigate this risk these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply the 8080 and 8086 series microprocessors were produced by several companies notably amd grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories santa clara california santa clara california hillsboro oregon hillsboro oregon and chandler arizona chandler a suburb of phoenix arizona phoenix arizona he convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery as the success of compaq s deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant cpu choice intel achieved a position of near exclusive dominance as its supplier profits from this funded rapid development of both higher performance chip designs and higher performance manufacturing capabilities propelling intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s 486 pentium and itanium intel introduced the intel 80486 486 microprocessor in 1989 and in 1990 formally established a second design team designing the processors code named p5 and p6 in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken engineers vinod dham and rajeev chandrasekhar member of parliament india were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later intel s signature pentium chip the p5 was earlier known as operation bicycle referring to the cycles of the processor the p5 microarchitecture p5 was introduced in 1993 as the intel pentium brand pentium substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number numbers such as 486 are hard to register as a trademark the p6 followed in 1995 as the pentium pro and improved into the pentium ii in 1997 new architectures were developed alternately in santa clara california and hillsboro oregon the santa clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 x86 architecture codenamed p7 the first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with hewlett packard engineers though intel soon took over primary design responsibility the resulting implementation of the itanium ia 64 64 bit architecture was the itanium finally introduced in june 2001 the itanium s performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations and it failed to compete effectively with x86 64 which was amd s 64 bit extensions to the original x86 architecture intel uses the name intel 64 previously em64t as of 2012 intel continues to develop and deploy the itanium known planning continues into 2014 the hillsboro team designed the pentium 4 willamette willamette processors initially code named p68 which were marketed as the pentium 4 pentium flaw in june 1994 intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating point math subsection of the p5 microarchitecture p5 pentium pentium microprocessor under certain data dependent conditions the low order bits of the result of a floating point division would be incorrect the error could compound in subsequent calculations intel corrected the error in a future chip revision but nonetheless declined to disclose it in october 1994 dr thomas nicely professor of mathematics at lynchburg college independently discovered the software bug bug he contacted intel but received no response on october 30 he posted a message on the internet word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press the bug was easy to replicate a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system consequently many users did not accept intel s statements that the error was minor and not even an erratum during thanksgiving in 1994 the new york times ran a piece by journalist john markoff spotlighting the error intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip quickly putting in place a large end user technical support support organization this resulted in a 500 nbsp million charge against intel s 1994 revenue ironically the pentium flaw incident intel s response to it and the surrounding media coverage propelled intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name dovetailing with an uptick in the intel inside campaign the episode is considered to have been a positive event for intel changing some of its business practices to be more end user focused and generating substantial public awareness while avoiding a lasting negative impression needs page number intel inside and other 1990s programs during this period intel undertook two major supporting programs the first is widely known the 1991 intel inside marketing and branding campaign the idea of ingredient branding was new at the time with only nutrasweet and a few others making attempts to do so this campaign established intel which had been a component supplier little known outside the pc industry as a household name the second program is little known intel s systems group began in the early 1990s manufacturing pc motherboards the main board component of a personal computer and the one into which the processor cpu and memory ram chips are plugged shortly after intel began manufacturing fully configured white box systems for the dozens of pc clone companies that rapidly sprang up at its peak in the mid 1990s intel manufactured over 15 of all pcs making it the third largest supplier at the time during the 1990s intel s intel architecture labs architecture lab ial was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer including the peripheral component interconnect pci bus the pci express pcie bus the universal serial bus usb ial s software efforts met with a more mixed fate its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video but later its efforts were

personal computer pc demand growth beginning in 2000 and the rise of the low cost pc by the end of the 1990s microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that cpu power aside from high end server systems and software whose demand dropped with the end of the dot com bubble consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low cost systems after 2000 intel s strategy of producing ever more powerful processors and obsoleting their predecessors stumbled leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors notably amd this in turn lowered the profitability of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the pc hardware by intel intel s dominance in the x86 microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years including federal trade commission ftc investigations in both the late 1980s and in 1999 and civil actions such as the 1997 suit by digital equipment corporation dec and a patent suit by intergraph intel s market dominance at one time it controlled over 85 of the market for 32 bit x86 microprocessors combined with intel s own hardball legal tactics such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus pc manufacturers made it an attractive target for litigation but few of the lawsuits ever amounted to anything a case of industrial espionage arose in 1995 that involved both intel and amd bill gaede an argentina argentine formerly employed both at amd and at intel s chandler arizona arizona plant was arrested for attempting in 1993 to sell the i486 and p5 microarchitecture p5 pentium designs to amd

center pc and the business desktop intel vpro in mid january 2006 intel announced that they were dropping the long running pentium name from their processors the pentium name was first used to refer to the p5 core intel processors pent refers to the 5 in p5 and was done to circumvent court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers so competitors could not just call their processor the same name as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors both of which had copies manufactured by ibm and amd they phased out the pentium names from mobile processors first when the new yonah microprocessor yonah chips branded intel core core solo and core duo were released the desktop processors changed when the core 2 line of processors were released by 2009 intel was using

granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate as a result of this intel became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community linspire linux creator michael robertson businessman michael robertson outlined the difficult position that intel was in releasing to open source as intel did not want to upset their large customer microsoft theo de raadt of openbsd also claimed that intel is being an open source fraud after

technologies silicon integrated systems sis and nvidia intel s competitors in networking include freescale infineon broadcom marvell technology group and applied micro circuits corporation amcc and competitors in flash memory include spansion samsung qimonda toshiba stmicroelectronics and hynix the only major competitor in the x86 processor market is advanced micro devices amd with which intel has had full cross licensing agreements since 1976 each partner can use the other s patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time however the cross licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an amd bankruptcy or takeover some smaller competitors such as via technologies via and transmeta produce low power electronics low power x86 processors for small factor computers and portable equipment however the advent of such mobile computing devices in particular smartphones has in recent years led to a decline in pc sales this is seen as the main reason for

intel in the federal district court amd lawsuit disputing amd s claims and claiming that intel s business practices are fair and lawful in a rebuttal intel deconstructed amd s offensive strategy and argued that amd struggled largely as a result of its own bad business decisions including underinvestment in essential manufacturing capacity and excessive reliance on contracting out chip foundries legal analysts predicted the lawsuit would drag on for a number of years since intel s initial response indicated its unwillingness to settle with amd in 2008 a court date was finally set but in 2009 intel settled with a 1 25 nbsp billion payout to amd see below in october 2006 a transmeta lawsuit against intel corporation transmeta lawsuit was filed against intel for patent infringement on

allegations going back to 2003 include giving preferential prices to computer makers buying most or all of their microprocessor chips from intel paying computer makers to delay or cancel the launch of products using amd chips and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions intel responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as consumer friendly in february 2008 intel stated that its office in munich had been raided by european union regulators intel reported that it was cooperating with investigators intel faced

made a serious and sustained violation of the eu s antitrust rules in june 2008 the fair trade commission ordered intel to pay a fine of us 25 5 nbsp million for taking advantage of its dominant position to offer incentives to major korean pc manufacturers on the condition of not buying products from amd united states new york started an investigation of intel in january 2008 on whether the

them of bribery and coercion claiming that intel bribed computer makers to buy more of their chips than those of their rivals and threatened to withdraw these payments if the computer makers were perceived as working too closely with its competitors intel has denied these claims on july 22 2010 dell agreed to a settlement with the u s securities and exchange commission sec to pay 100m in

expectations regarding the company s financial performance these exclusivity payments grew from 10 percent of dell s operating income in fy 2003 to 38 percent in fy 2006 and peaked at 76 percent in the first quarter of fy 2007 dell eventually did adopt amd as a secondary supplier in 2006 and intel subsequently stopped their rebates causing dell s financial performance to fall market share

certification program marketing sales practices in 1990 oracle laid off 10 about 400 people of its work force because of accounting errors this became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice and also settled out of court class action class action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings ellison stated in 1992 that oracle had made an incredible business mistake competition although ibm dominated the mainframe relational database market with its db2 and sql ds database products it delayedentering the market for a relational database on unix and windows operating systems this left the door open for sybase oracle and informix corporation informix and eventually microsoft to dominate mid range and microcomputers around this time oracle technology started to lag technically behind that of sybase in 1990 1993 sybase became the fastest growing database company and the database industry s darling vendor but soon fell victim to its merger mania and to technical issues with system x sybase s 1993 merger with powersoft resulted in its losing its focus on its core database technology in 1993 sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the windows operating system to microsoft corporation which markets it under the name sql server in 1994 informix overtook sybase and became oracle s most important rival the intense war between informix ceo phil white and ellison made front page news in silicon valley for three years informix claimed that oracle had hired away informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product informix finally dropped its lawsuit against oracle in 1997 in november 2005 a book detailing the war between oracle and informix was published titled the real story of informix software and phil white it gave a detailed chronology of the battle of informix against oracle and how informix software s ceo phil white landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking ellison once it had overcome informix and sybase oracle corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until use of microsoft sql server became widespread in the late 1990s and ibm acquired informix software in 2001 to complement its db2 database oracle competes for new database licenses on unix linux and windows operating systems primarily against ibm s db2 and microsoft sql server which only runs on windows ibm s db2 dominates the mainframe database market in 2004 oracle s

postgresql has made inroads by proclaiming that its product delivers oracle compatibility features at a much lower price point in the software applications market oracle corporation primarily competes against sap ag sap on march 22 2007 oracle sued sap accusing them of fraud and unfair competition in the market for business intelligence software many other software companies small and large have successfully competed in quality with oracle and sap products business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the big four consolidated bi firms such as oracle who has entered bi market through a recent trend of acquisitions including hyperion solutions and the independent pure play vendors such as microstrategy actuate corporation actuate and sas institute inc sas oracle and sap from 1988 oracle corporation and the german company sap ag had a decade long history of cooperation beginning with the integration of sap s sap r 3 r 3 enterprise application suite with oracle s relational database products the marketplace regarded the two firms products as complementing one another rather than as substitutes despite the current when sap partnership with microsoft and the increasing integration of sap applications with microsoft products such as microsoft sql server a competitor to oracle database oracle and sap continue their cooperation according to oracle corporation the majority of sap s customers use oracle databases in years however competition between oracle and sap has increased and as a result the rivalry between the two companies has grown even developing into a feud between the co founders of the two companies where one party would frequently voice strong negative comments about the other company in 2004 oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise applications market in 1989 oracle had already released oracle financials a series of acquisitions by oracle corporation began most notably those of peoplesoft siebel systems and hyperion solutions hyperion sap recognized that oracle had started to become a competitor in a market where sap had the leadership and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that oracle corporation had acquired sap would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications oracle corporation would resort to a similar strategy by advising sap customers to get off sap a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform oracle fusion for sap and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to sap customers who chose oracle corporation products oracle and sap the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary tomorrownow compete in the third party enterprise software maintenance and support market on march 22 2007 oracle filed a lawsuit against sap in oracle corporation v sap ag oracle alleged that tomorrownow which provides discount support for legacy oracle product lines used the accounts of former oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from oracle s website and to appropriate them for sap s use some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by oracle corporation to decrease competition with sap in the market for third party enterprise software maintenance and support on july 3 2007 sap admitted that tomorrownow employees had made inappropriate downloads from the oracle support web site however it claims that sap personnel and sap customers had no access to oracle intellectual property via tomorrownow sap s ceo henning kagermann stated that even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective we regret very much that this occurred additionally sap announced that it had instituted changes in tomorrownow s operational oversight on november 23 2010 a united states district court for the northern district of california u s district court jury in oakland california found that sap ag must pay oracle corp 1 3 nbsp billion for copyright infringement awarding damages that could be the largest ever for copyright infringement while admitting liability sap estimated the damages at no more than 40 nbsp million while oracle claimed that they are at least 1 65 nbsp billion the awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in u s legal history sap said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal on september 1 2011 a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial calling oracle s original award grossly excessive oracle chose a new trial on august 3 2012 sap and oracle agreed on a judgment for 306 million in damages pending approval from the u s district court judge to save time and expense of a new trial after the accord has been approved oracle can ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the earlier jury verdict in addition to the damages payment sap has already paid oracle 120 million for its legal fees slogans

to work together media oracle corporation produces and distributes the oracle clearview series of videos as part of its marketing mix controversies trashgate in 2000 oracle gained attention from the computer industry and the press after hiring private investigators to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an united states v microsoft antitrust trial involving microsoft the chairman of oracle corporation larry ellison staunchly defended his company s hiring of an east coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival microsoft corporation during its antitrust trial calling the snooping a public service the investigation reportedly included a 1 200 offer to janitors at the association for competitive technology to look through microsoft s trash asked how he d feel if others were looking into oracle s business activities ellison said we will ship our garbage to redmond and they can go through it we believe in full disclosure can break it can break in at one point oracle corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan can t break it can t break in or unbreakable this signifies a demand on information security oracle corporation also stresses the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points however two weeks after its introduction in 2002 david litchfield alexander kornbrust cesar cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against oracle products commentators criticized the slogan as unrealistic and as an invitation to security cracking crackers but oracle corporation s chief security officer mary ann davidson portrayed the criticism as unfair rather than representing a literal claim of oracle s products impregnability she saw the campaign in the context of fourteen independent security evaluations that oracle corporation s database server had passed relationship with john ashcroft in 2004 then united states attorney general john ashcroft sued oracle corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multi billion dollar intelligence contract after ashcroft s resignation from government he founded a lobbying firm the ashcroft group which oracle hired in 2005 with the group s help oracle went on to acquire the contract expeditionary combat support system computer sciences corporation reportedly spent a billion dollars developing a computer system for the united states air force that yielded no significant capability because according to an air force source the oracle software on which the system was based could not be adapted to meet the specialized performance criteria events acquisition of sun microsystems on january 27 2010 oracle announced it had completed its acquisition of sun microsystems valued at more than 7 nbsp billion a move that transformed oracle from solely a software company to a manufacturer of both software and hardware the acquisition was delayed for several months by the eu commission because of concerns about mysql but was unconditionally approved in the end this acquisition was important to some in the open source community and also to some other companies as they feared oracle might end sun s traditional support of open source projects since the acquisition oracle has discontinued opensolaris and staroffice and sued google over their newly acquired java programming language java patents from sun in september 2011 a wikileaks cable was published revealing that the u s pressured the e u to allow oracle to acquire sun justice department lawsuit on july 29 2010 the united states department of justice filed suit against oracle corporation alleging fraud the lawsuit argues that the government received deals inferior to those oracle gave to its commercial clients the doj added

august 11 2010 phase forward a company that developed data management systems for the pharmaceutical industry became a wholly owned subsidiary of oracle corporation some analysts believe this

where spending has stayed strong despite economic turmoil in other sectors it s also primed for growth in the united states where it s the focus of major government reform efforts lawsuit against google on august 12 2010 oracle announced a lawsuit against google concerning patent and copyright infringement of java programming language java in google s development of android operating system android oracle claimed that google s android competes with oracle america s java and that google has been aware of sun s patent portfolio since google hired certain former sun java engineers oracle acquired the java patents when it bought sun microsystems in january 2010 google s reimplementation of the java platform supports most java functionality apart from abstract window toolkit awt and swing java swing instead supplying a native widget toolkit oracle originally sought damages up to 6 1 billion but this valuation was rejected by a federal judge who asked oracle to revise the estimate in may 2012 the jury in this case found that google did not infringe on oracle s patents and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the java apis used by google was not copyrightable on september 5 2012 oracle was ordered by a federal judge to pay google s legal fees which were over 1 million google has accused apple oracle and microsoft of trying to take down android through patent litigation rather than innovating and competing with better products and services in august 2011 google started the process of purchasing motorola mobility for usd us 12 5 billion which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect android since motorola mobility holds more than 17 000 patents in late may 2012 it successfully completed acquisition of the company thus adding its patents portfolio virtually unto its own as a potential defensive measure google has also acquired thousands of patents from ibm discontinuation of opensolaris on august 13 2010 an internal oracle memo leaked to the
