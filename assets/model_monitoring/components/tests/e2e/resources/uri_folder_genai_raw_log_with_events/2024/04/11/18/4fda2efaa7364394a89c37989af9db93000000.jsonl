Azure Machine Learning offers featurizations specifically for these tasks, such as deep neural network text featurizers for classification. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nThe main goal of classification models is to predict which categories new data will fall into based on learnings from its training data. Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\n\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\n\\n### Regression\\n\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task. Azure Machine Learning offers featurization specific to regression problems. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nDifferent from classification where predicted output values are categorical, regression models predict numerical output values based on independent predictors. In regression, the objective is to help establish the relationship among those independent predictor variables by estimating how one variable impacts the others. For example, automobile price based on features like, gas mileage, safety rating, etc. \\n\\nSee an example of regression and automated machine learning for predictions in these Python notebooks: [Hardware Performance](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance.ipynb).\\n\\n\\n### Time-series forecasting\\n\\nBuilding forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. You can use automated ML to combine techniques and approaches and get a recommended, high-quality time-series forecast. You can find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nAn automated time-series experiment is treated as a multivariate regression problem. Past time-series values are \\\"pivoted\\\" to become additional dimensions for the regressor together with other predictors. This approach, unlike classical time series methods, has an advantage of naturally incorporating multiple contextual variables and their relationship to one another during training. Automated ML learns a single, but often internally branched model for all items in the dataset and prediction horizons. More data is thus available to estimate model parameters and generalization to unseen series becomes possible.\\n\\nAdvanced forecasting configuration includes:\\n* holiday detection and featurization\\n* time-series and DNN learners (Auto-ARIMA, Prophet, ForecastTCN)\\n* many models support through grouping\\n* rolling-origin cross validation\\n* configurable lags\\n* rolling window aggregate features\\n\\nSee an example of forecasting and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Energy Demand](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand-advanced.ipynb).\\n\\n### Computer vision\\n\\nSupport for computer vision tasks allows you to easily generate models trained on image data for scenarios like image classification and object detection. \\n\\nWith this capability you can: \\n \\n* Seamlessly integrate with the [Azure Machine Learning data labeling](.\/how-to-create-image-labeling-projects.md) capability\\n* Use labeled data for generating image models\\n* Optimize model performance by specifying the model algorithm and tuning the hyperparameters. \\n* Download or deploy the resulting model as a web service in Azure Machine Learning. \\n* Operationalize at scale, leveraging Azure Machine Learning [MLOps](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) and [ML Pipelines](concept-ml-pipelines.md) capabilities.\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"id\": \"Y29uY2VwdC1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtbWwubWQx\",\n        \"source\": {\n          \"title\": \"What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\",\n          \"filename\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\",\n          \"url\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\",\n          \"mtime\": 1710206108.0\n        },\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"tiktokens\": 920,\n          \"chars\": 4752,\n          \"lines\": 52\n        },\n        \"content_hash\": \"809c865d2d03bfc9f56027491f6ca2dbcbb708f8b1a18a52b147070b31c6f767\"\n      },\n      \"score\": 0.028949543833732605\n    }\n  ]\n}","output":"\"Content: # What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\\n\\n---\\ntitle: What is automated ML?

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML in Azure Machine Learning is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/research\/project\/automl\/).\\n\\n* For code-experienced customers, [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install).  Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model (preview) with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).\\n\\n\\n## How does AutoML work?\\n\\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The better the score for the metric you want to optimize for, the better the model is considered to \\\"fit\\\" your data.  It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. \\n\\nUsing **Azure Machine Learning**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, regression, computer vision or NLP.\\n\\n1. **Choose whether you want a code-first experience or a no-code studio web experience**: Users who prefer a code-first experience can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDKv2](how-to-configure-auto-train.md) or the [Azure Machine Learning CLIv2](how-to-train-cli.md). Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md). Users who prefer a limited\/no-code experience can use the [web interface](how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models.md) in Azure Machine Learning studio at [https:\/\/ml.azure.com](https:\/\/ml.azure.com\/).  Get started with [Tutorial: Create a classification model with automated ML in Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md).\\n    \\n1. **Specify the source of the labeled training data**: You can bring your data to Azure Machine Learning in [many different ways](concept-data.md).\\n\\n1. **Configure the automated machine learning parameters** that determine how many iterations over different models, hyperparameter settings, advanced preprocessing\/featurization, and what metrics to look at when determining the best model.  \\n1. **Submit the training job.**\\n\\n1. **Review the results** \\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates this process. \\n![Automated Machine learning](.\/media\/concept-automated-ml\/automl-concept-diagram2.png)\\n\\n\\nYou can also inspect the logged job information, which [contains metrics](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md) gathered during the job. The training job produces a Python serialized object (`.pkl` file) that contains the model and data preprocessing.\\n\\nWhile model building is automated, you can also [learn how important or relevant features are](.\/v1\/how-to-configure-auto-train.md?view=azureml-api-1\u0026preserve-view=true#explain) to the generated models.\\n\\n## When to use AutoML: classification, regression, forecasting, computer vision \u0026 NLP\\n\\nApply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify. Automated ML democratizes the machine learning model development process, and empowers its users, no matter their data science expertise, to identify an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for any problem.\\nSource: concept-automated-ml.md\\n\\nContent: # What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\n---\\ntitle: What is Azure Machine Learning?\\ndescription: 'Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.'\\nservices: machine-learning\\nms.service: machine-learning\\nms.subservice: core\\nms.topic: overview\\nauthor: frogglew\\nms.author: saoh\\nms.reviewer: sgilley\\nms.date: 09\/22\/2022\\nms.custom:\\n  - event-tier1-build-2022\\n  - ignite-2022\\n  - build-2023\\n  - build-2023-dataai\\n  - ignite-2023\\nadobe-target: true\\n---\\n\\n# What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\nAzure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle.

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML in Azure Machine Learning is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/research\/project\/automl\/).\\n\\n* For code-experienced customers, [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install).  Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model (preview) with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).\\n\\n\\n## How does AutoML work?\\n\\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The better the score for the metric you want to optimize for, the better the model is considered to \\\"fit\\\" your data.  It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. \\n\\nUsing **Azure Machine Learning**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, regression, computer vision or NLP.\\n\\n1. **Choose whether you want a code-first experience or a no-code studio web experience**: Users who prefer a code-first experience can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDKv2](how-to-configure-auto-train.md) or the [Azure Machine Learning CLIv2](how-to-train-cli.md). Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md). Users who prefer a limited\/no-code experience can use the [web interface](how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models.md) in Azure Machine Learning studio at [https:\/\/ml.azure.com](https:\/\/ml.azure.com\/).  Get started with [Tutorial: Create a classification model with automated ML in Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md).\\n    \\n1. **Specify the source of the labeled training data**: You can bring your data to Azure Machine Learning in [many different ways](concept-data.md).\\n\\n1. **Configure the automated machine learning parameters** that determine how many iterations over different models, hyperparameter settings, advanced preprocessing\/featurization, and what metrics to look at when determining the best model.  \\n1. **Submit the training job.**\\n\\n1. **Review the results** \\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates this process. \\n![Automated Machine learning](.\/media\/concept-automated-ml\/automl-concept-diagram2.png)\\n\\n\\nYou can also inspect the logged job information, which [contains metrics](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md) gathered during the job. The training job produces a Python serialized object (`.pkl` file) that contains the model and data preprocessing.\\n\\nWhile model building is automated, you can also [learn how important or relevant features are](.\/v1\/how-to-configure-auto-train.md?view=azureml-api-1\u0026preserve-view=true#explain) to the generated models.\\n\\n## When to use AutoML: classification, regression, forecasting, computer vision \u0026 NLP\\n\\nApply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify. Automated ML democratizes the machine learning model development process, and empowers its users, no matter their data science expertise, to identify an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for any problem.\", \"document.score\": 0.03306011110544205, \"document.metadata\": {\"id\": \"Y29uY2VwdC1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtbWwubWQw\", \"source\": {\"title\": \"What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\", \"filename\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\", \"url\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\", \"mtime\": 1710206108.0}, \"stats\": {\"tiktokens\": 917, \"chars\": 4285, \"lines\": 54}, \"content_hash\": \"31e414a5d2519ab0d146d5c298f0466ca41af9f9a274b7784fc0d903c256ee73\"}}, {\"document.content\": \"# What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\n---\\ntitle: What is Azure Machine Learning?\\ndescription: 'Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.'\\nservices: machine-learning\\nms.service: machine-learning\\nms.subservice: core\\nms.topic: overview\\nauthor: frogglew\\nms.author: saoh\\nms.reviewer: sgilley\\nms.date: 09\/22\/2022\\nms.custom:\\n  - event-tier1-build-2022\\n  - ignite-2022\\n  - build-2023\\n  - build-2023-dataai\\n  - ignite-2023\\nadobe-target: true\\n---\\n\\n# What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\nAzure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle.

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML in Azure Machine Learning is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/research\/project\/automl\/).\\n\\n* For code-experienced customers, [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install).  Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model (preview) with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).\\n\\n\\n## How does AutoML work?\\n\\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The better the score for the metric you want to optimize for, the better the model is considered to \\\"fit\\\" your data.  It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. \\n\\nUsing **Azure Machine Learning**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, regression, computer vision or NLP.\\n\\n1. **Choose whether you want a code-first experience or a no-code studio web experience**: Users who prefer a code-first experience can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDKv2](how-to-configure-auto-train.md) or the [Azure Machine Learning CLIv2](how-to-train-cli.md). Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md). Users who prefer a limited\/no-code experience can use the [web interface](how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models.md) in Azure Machine Learning studio at [https:\/\/ml.azure.com](https:\/\/ml.azure.com\/).  Get started with [Tutorial: Create a classification model with automated ML in Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md).\\n    \\n1. **Specify the source of the labeled training data**: You can bring your data to Azure Machine Learning in [many different ways](concept-data.md).\\n\\n1. **Configure the automated machine learning parameters** that determine how many iterations over different models, hyperparameter settings, advanced preprocessing\/featurization, and what metrics to look at when determining the best model.  \\n1. **Submit the training job.**\\n\\n1. **Review the results** \\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates this process. \\n![Automated Machine learning](.\/media\/concept-automated-ml\/automl-concept-diagram2.png)\\n\\n\\nYou can also inspect the logged job information, which [contains metrics](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md) gathered during the job. The training job produces a Python serialized object (`.pkl` file) that contains the model and data preprocessing.\\n\\nWhile model building is automated, you can also [learn how important or relevant features are](.\/v1\/how-to-configure-auto-train.md?view=azureml-api-1\u0026preserve-view=true#explain) to the generated models.\\n\\n## When to use AutoML: classification, regression, forecasting, computer vision \u0026 NLP\\n\\nApply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify. Automated ML democratizes the machine learning model development process, and empowers its users, no matter their data science expertise, to identify an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for any problem.\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"id\": \"Y29uY2VwdC1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtbWwubWQw\",\n      \"source\": {\n        \"title\": \"What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\",\n        \"filename\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\",\n        \"url\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\",\n        \"mtime\": 1710206108.0\n      },\n      \"stats\": {\n        \"tiktokens\": 917,\n        \"chars\": 4285,\n        \"lines\": 54\n      },\n      \"content_hash\": \"31e414a5d2519ab0d146d5c298f0466ca41af9f9a274b7784fc0d903c256ee73\"\n    },\n    \"score\": 0.03306011110544205\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"# What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\n---\\ntitle: What is Azure Machine Learning?\\ndescription: 'Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.'\\nservices: machine-learning\\nms.service: machine-learning\\nms.subservice: core\\nms.topic: overview\\nauthor: frogglew\\nms.author: saoh\\nms.reviewer: sgilley\\nms.date: 09\/22\/2022\\nms.custom:\\n  - event-tier1-build-2022\\n  - ignite-2022\\n  - build-2023\\n  - build-2023-dataai\\n  - ignite-2023\\nadobe-target: true\\n---\\n\\n# What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\nAzure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle.

You can set up a project to deny access to protected data and select operations.\\n\\n## Productivity for everyone on the team\\n\\nML projects often require a team with a varied skill set to build and maintain. Machine Learning has tools that help enable you to:\\n\\n* Collaborate with your team via shared notebooks, compute resources, [serverless compute](how-to-use-serverless-compute.md), data, and environments\\n\\n* Develop models for fairness and explainability, tracking and auditability to fulfill lineage and audit compliance requirements\\n\\n* Deploy ML models quickly and easily at scale, and manage and govern them efficiently with MLOps\\n\\n* Run machine learning workloads anywhere with built-in governance, security, and compliance\\n\\n### Cross-compatible platform tools that meet your needs\\n\\nAnyone on an ML team can use their preferred tools to get the job done. Whether you're running rapid experiments, hyperparameter-tuning, building pipelines, or managing inferences, you can use familiar interfaces including:\\n\\n* [Azure Machine Learning studio](https:\/\/ml.azure.com)\\n* [Python SDK (v2)](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install)\\n* [Azure CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md))\\n* [Azure Resource Manager REST APIs](\/rest\/api\/azureml\/)\\n\\nAs you're refining the model and collaborating with others throughout the rest of the Machine Learning development cycle, you can share and find assets, resources, and metrics for your projects on the Machine Learning studio UI.\\n\\n### Studio\\n\\n[Machine Learning studio](https:\/\/ml.azure.com) offers multiple authoring experiences depending on the type of project and the level of your past ML experience, without having to install anything.\\n\\n* **Notebooks**: Write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.\\n* **Visualize run metrics**: Analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.\\n\\n    :::image type=\\\"content\\\" source=\\\"media\/how-to-log-view-metrics\/metrics.png\\\" alt-text=\\\"Screenshot that shows metrics for a training run.\\\":::\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"id\": \"b3ZlcnZpZXctd2hhdC1pcy1henVyZS1tYWNoaW5lLWxlYXJuaW5nLm1kMA==\",\n      \"source\": {\n        \"title\": \"What is Azure Machine Learning?\",\n        \"filename\": \"overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md\",\n        \"url\": \"overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md\",\n        \"mtime\": 1710206170.0\n      },\n      \"stats\": {\n        \"tiktokens\": 890,\n        \"chars\": 4236,\n        \"lines\": 70\n      },\n      \"content_hash\": \"f62f111e76fa5aa7fc9ccd28e2b0b5da19aa05ac23d05fa03f506c4d197be7b4\"\n    },\n    \"score\": 0.030477948486804962\n  },\n  {\n    \"text\": \"# What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\\n\\nML professionals and developers across industries can use automated ML to:\\n+ Implement ML solutions without extensive programming knowledge\\n+ Save time and resources\\n+ Leverage data science best practices\\n+ Provide agile problem-solving\\n\\n### Classification\\n\\nClassification is a type of supervised learning in which models learn using training data, and apply those learnings to new data. Azure Machine Learning offers featurizations specifically for these tasks, such as deep neural network text featurizers for classification. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nThe main goal of classification models is to predict which categories new data will fall into based on learnings from its training data. Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\n\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\n\\n### Regression\\n\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task. Azure Machine Learning offers featurization specific to regression problems. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization).

You can set up a project to deny access to protected data and select operations.\\n\\n## Productivity for everyone on the team\\n\\nML projects often require a team with a varied skill set to build and maintain. Machine Learning has tools that help enable you to:\\n\\n* Collaborate with your team via shared notebooks, compute resources, [serverless compute](how-to-use-serverless-compute.md), data, and environments\\n\\n* Develop models for fairness and explainability, tracking and auditability to fulfill lineage and audit compliance requirements\\n\\n* Deploy ML models quickly and easily at scale, and manage and govern them efficiently with MLOps\\n\\n* Run machine learning workloads anywhere with built-in governance, security, and compliance\\n\\n### Cross-compatible platform tools that meet your needs\\n\\nAnyone on an ML team can use their preferred tools to get the job done.

Azure Machine Learning offers featurizations specifically for these tasks, such as deep neural network text featurizers for classification. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nThe main goal of classification models is to predict which categories new data will fall into based on learnings from its training data. Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\n\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\n\\n### Regression\\n\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task. Azure Machine Learning offers featurization specific to regression problems. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nDifferent from classification where predicted output values are categorical, regression models predict numerical output values based on independent predictors. In regression, the objective is to help establish the relationship among those independent predictor variables by estimating how one variable impacts the others. For example, automobile price based on features like, gas mileage, safety rating, etc. \\n\\nSee an example of regression and automated machine learning for predictions in these Python notebooks: [Hardware Performance](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance.ipynb).\\n\\n\\n### Time-series forecasting\\n\\nBuilding forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. You can use automated ML to combine techniques and approaches and get a recommended, high-quality time-series forecast. You can find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nAn automated time-series experiment is treated as a multivariate regression problem. Past time-series values are \\\"pivoted\\\" to become additional dimensions for the regressor together with other predictors. This approach, unlike classical time series methods, has an advantage of naturally incorporating multiple contextual variables and their relationship to one another during training. Automated ML learns a single, but often internally branched model for all items in the dataset and prediction horizons. More data is thus available to estimate model parameters and generalization to unseen series becomes possible.\\n\\nAdvanced forecasting configuration includes:\\n* holiday detection and featurization\\n* time-series and DNN learners (Auto-ARIMA, Prophet, ForecastTCN)\\n* many models support through grouping\\n* rolling-origin cross validation\\n* configurable lags\\n* rolling window aggregate features\\n\\nSee an example of forecasting and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Energy Demand](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand-advanced.ipynb).\\n\\n### Computer vision\\n\\nSupport for computer vision tasks allows you to easily generate models trained on image data for scenarios like image classification and object detection. \\n\\nWith this capability you can: \\n \\n* Seamlessly integrate with the [Azure Machine Learning data labeling](.\/how-to-create-image-labeling-projects.md) capability\\n* Use labeled data for generating image models\\n* Optimize model performance by specifying the model algorithm and tuning the hyperparameters. \\n* Download or deploy the resulting model as a web service in Azure Machine Learning. \\n* Operationalize at scale, leveraging Azure Machine Learning [MLOps](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) and [ML Pipelines](concept-ml-pipelines.md) capabilities.\\nSource: concept-automated-ml.md \\n\\n chat history: \\nuser: what is aml? \\nassistant:\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"temperature\": 1.0,\n  \"top_p\": 1.0,\n  \"n\": 1,\n  \"stream\": false,\n  \"presence_penalty\": 0.0,\n  \"frequency_penalty\": 0.0,\n  \"user\": \"\"\n}","llm.response.model":"gpt-4-32k","llm.generated_message":"{\n  \"content\": \"Azure Machine Learning (AML) is a cloud service designed to manage and accelerate the machine learning project lifecycle.

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML in Azure Machine Learning is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/research\/project\/automl\/).\\n\\n* For code-experienced customers, [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install).  Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model (preview) with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).\\n\\n\\n## How does AutoML work?\\n\\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The better the score for the metric you want to optimize for, the better the model is considered to \\\"fit\\\" your data.  It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. \\n\\nUsing **Azure Machine Learning**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, regression, computer vision or NLP.\\n\\n1. **Choose whether you want a code-first experience or a no-code studio web experience**: Users who prefer a code-first experience can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDKv2](how-to-configure-auto-train.md) or the [Azure Machine Learning CLIv2](how-to-train-cli.md).

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML in Azure Machine Learning is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/research\/project\/automl\/).\\n\\n* For code-experienced customers, [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install).  Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model (preview) with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).\\n\\n\\n## How does AutoML work?\\n\\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The better the score for the metric you want to optimize for, the better the model is considered to \\\"fit\\\" your data.  It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. \\n\\nUsing **Azure Machine Learning**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, regression, computer vision or NLP.\\n\\n1. **Choose whether you want a code-first experience or a no-code studio web experience**: Users who prefer a code-first experience can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDKv2](how-to-configure-auto-train.md) or the [Azure Machine Learning CLIv2](how-to-train-cli.md). Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md). Users who prefer a limited\/no-code experience can use the [web interface](how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models.md) in Azure Machine Learning studio at [https:\/\/ml.azure.com](https:\/\/ml.azure.com\/).  Get started with [Tutorial: Create a classification model with automated ML in Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md).\\n    \\n1. **Specify the source of the labeled training data**: You can bring your data to Azure Machine Learning in [many different ways](concept-data.md).\\n\\n1. **Configure the automated machine learning parameters** that determine how many iterations over different models, hyperparameter settings, advanced preprocessing\/featurization, and what metrics to look at when determining the best model.  \\n1. **Submit the training job.**\\n\\n1. **Review the results** \\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates this process. \\n![Automated Machine learning](.\/media\/concept-automated-ml\/automl-concept-diagram2.png)\\n\\n\\nYou can also inspect the logged job information, which [contains metrics](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md) gathered during the job. The training job produces a Python serialized object (`.pkl` file) that contains the model and data preprocessing.\\n\\nWhile model building is automated, you can also [learn how important or relevant features are](.\/v1\/how-to-configure-auto-train.md?view=azureml-api-1\u0026preserve-view=true#explain) to the generated models.\\n\\n## When to use AutoML: classification, regression, forecasting, computer vision \u0026 NLP\\n\\nApply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify. Automated ML democratizes the machine learning model development process, and empowers its users, no matter their data science expertise, to identify an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for any problem.\\nSource: concept-automated-ml.md\\n\\nContent: # What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\n---\\ntitle: What is Azure Machine Learning?\\ndescription: 'Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.'\\nservices: machine-learning\\nms.service: machine-learning\\nms.subservice: core\\nms.topic: overview\\nauthor: frogglew\\nms.author: saoh\\nms.reviewer: sgilley\\nms.date: 09\/22\/2022\\nms.custom:\\n  - event-tier1-build-2022\\n  - ignite-2022\\n  - build-2023\\n  - build-2023-dataai\\n  - ignite-2023\\nadobe-target: true\\n---\\n\\n# What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\nAzure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle.

Your credit card is never charged unless you explicitly change your settings and ask to be charged.\\n\\n## Who is Azure Machine Learning for?\\n\\nMachine Learning is for individuals and teams implementing MLOps within their organization to bring ML models into production in a secure and auditable production environment.\\n\\nData scientists and ML engineers can use tools to accelerate and automate their day-to-day workflows. Application developers can use tools for integrating models into applications or services.

Azure Machine Learning offers featurizations specifically for these tasks, such as deep neural network text featurizers for classification. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nThe main goal of classification models is to predict which categories new data will fall into based on learnings from its training data. Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\n\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\n\\n### Regression\\n\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task.

You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nDifferent from classification where predicted output values are categorical, regression models predict numerical output values based on independent predictors. In regression, the objective is to help establish the relationship among those independent predictor variables by estimating how one variable impacts the others. For example, automobile price based on features like, gas mileage, safety rating, etc. \\n\\nSee an example of regression and automated machine learning for predictions in these Python notebooks: [Hardware Performance](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance.ipynb).\\n\\n\\n### Time-series forecasting\\n\\nBuilding forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand.

You can find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nAn automated time-series experiment is treated as a multivariate regression problem. Past time-series values are \\\"pivoted\\\" to become additional dimensions for the regressor together with other predictors. This approach, unlike classical time series methods, has an advantage of naturally incorporating multiple contextual variables and their relationship to one another during training. Automated ML learns a single, but often internally branched model for all items in the dataset and prediction horizons. More data is thus available to estimate model parameters and generalization to unseen series becomes possible.\\n\\nAdvanced forecasting configuration includes:\\n* holiday detection and featurization\\n* time-series and DNN learners (Auto-ARIMA, Prophet, ForecastTCN)\\n* many models support through grouping\\n* rolling-origin cross validation\\n* configurable lags\\n* rolling window aggregate features\\n\\nSee an example of forecasting and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Energy Demand](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand-advanced.ipynb).\\n\\n### Computer vision\\n\\nSupport for computer vision tasks allows you to easily generate models trained on image data for scenarios like image classification and object detection. \\n\\nWith this capability you can: \\n \\n* Seamlessly integrate with the [Azure Machine Learning data labeling](.\/how-to-create-image-labeling-projects.md) capability\\n* Use labeled data for generating image models\\n* Optimize model performance by specifying the model algorithm and tuning the hyperparameters. \\n* Download or deploy the resulting model as a web service in Azure Machine Learning. \\n* Operationalize at scale, leveraging Azure Machine Learning [MLOps](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) and [ML Pipelines](concept-ml-pipelines.md) capabilities.\\nSource: concept-automated-ml.md \\n\\n chat history: \\nuser: what is aml? \\nassistant:\"\n}","inputs":"{\n  \"prompt\": \"{{prompt_text}}\",\n  \"deployment_name\": \"gpt-4-32k\",\n  \"temperature\": 1.0,\n  \"top_p\": 1.0,\n  \"presence_penalty\": 0.0,\n  \"frequency_penalty\": 0.0,\n  \"prompt_text\": \"system: \\nYou are an AI assistant that helps users answer questions given a specific context and conversation history.

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML in Azure Machine Learning is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/research\/project\/automl\/).\\\\n\\\\n* For code-experienced customers, [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install).  Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model (preview) with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## How does AutoML work?\\\\n\\\\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The better the score for the metric you want to optimize for, the better the model is considered to \\\\\\\"fit\\\\\\\" your data.  It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. \\\\n\\\\nUsing **Azure Machine Learning**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, regression, computer vision or NLP.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Choose whether you want a code-first experience or a no-code studio web experience**: Users who prefer a code-first experience can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDKv2](how-to-configure-auto-train.md) or the [Azure Machine Learning CLIv2](how-to-train-cli.md).

You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\\\n\\\\nThe main goal of classification models is to predict which categories new data will fall into based on learnings from its training data. Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\\\n\\\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\\\n\\\\n### Regression\\\\n\\\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task.

You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\\\n\\\\nDifferent from classification where predicted output values are categorical, regression models predict numerical output values based on independent predictors. In regression, the objective is to help establish the relationship among those independent predictor variables by estimating how one variable impacts the others. For example, automobile price based on features like, gas mileage, safety rating, etc. \\\\n\\\\nSee an example of regression and automated machine learning for predictions in these Python notebooks: [Hardware Performance](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance.ipynb).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### Time-series forecasting\\\\n\\\\nBuilding forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand.

You can set up a project to deny access to protected data and select operations.\\n\\n## Productivity for everyone on the team\\n\\nML projects often require a team with a varied skill set to build and maintain. Machine Learning has tools that help enable you to:\\n\\n* Collaborate with your team via shared notebooks, compute resources, [serverless compute](how-to-use-serverless-compute.md), data, and environments\\n\\n* Develop models for fairness and explainability, tracking and auditability to fulfill lineage and audit compliance requirements\\n\\n* Deploy ML models quickly and easily at scale, and manage and govern them efficiently with MLOps\\n\\n* Run machine learning workloads anywhere with built-in governance, security, and compliance\\n\\n### Cross-compatible platform tools that meet your needs\\n\\nAnyone on an ML team can use their preferred tools to get the job done. Whether you're running rapid experiments, hyperparameter-tuning, building pipelines, or managing inferences, you can use familiar interfaces including:\\n\\n* [Azure Machine Learning studio](https:\/\/ml.azure.com)\\n* [Python SDK (v2)](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install)\\n* [Azure CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md))\\n* [Azure Resource Manager REST APIs](\/rest\/api\/azureml\/)\\n\\nAs you're refining the model and collaborating with others throughout the rest of the Machine Learning development cycle, you can share and find assets, resources, and metrics for your projects on the Machine Learning studio UI.\\n\\n### Studio\\n\\n[Machine Learning studio](https:\/\/ml.azure.com) offers multiple authoring experiences depending on the type of project and the level of your past ML experience, without having to install anything.\\n\\n* **Notebooks**: Write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.\\n* **Visualize run metrics**: Analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.\\n\\n    :::image type=\\\"content\\\" source=\\\"media\/how-to-log-view-metrics\/metrics.png\\\" alt-text=\\\"Screenshot that shows metrics for a training run.\\\":::\", \"document.score\": 0.026810109615325928, \"document.metadata\": {\"id\": \"b3ZlcnZpZXctd2hhdC1pcy1henVyZS1tYWNoaW5lLWxlYXJuaW5nLm1kMA==\", \"source\": {\"title\": \"What is Azure Machine Learning?\", \"filename\": \"overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md\", \"url\": \"overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md\", \"mtime\": 1710206170.0}, \"stats\": {\"tiktokens\": 890, \"chars\": 4236, \"lines\": 70}, \"content_hash\": \"f62f111e76fa5aa7fc9ccd28e2b0b5da19aa05ac23d05fa03f506c4d197be7b4\"}}, {\"document.content\": \"# What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\\n\\nML professionals and developers across industries can use automated ML to:\\n+ Implement ML solutions without extensive programming knowledge\\n+ Save time and resources\\n+ Leverage data science best practices\\n+ Provide agile problem-solving\\n\\n### Classification\\n\\nClassification is a type of supervised learning in which models learn using training data, and apply those learnings to new data. Azure Machine Learning offers featurizations specifically for these tasks, such as deep neural network text featurizers for classification. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nThe main goal of classification models is to predict which categories new data will fall into based on learnings from its training data. Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\n\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\n\\n### Regression\\n\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task. Azure Machine Learning offers featurization specific to regression problems. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nDifferent from classification where predicted output values are categorical, regression models predict numerical output values based on independent predictors. In regression, the objective is to help establish the relationship among those independent predictor variables by estimating how one variable impacts the others. For example, automobile price based on features like, gas mileage, safety rating, etc. \\n\\nSee an example of regression and automated machine learning for predictions in these Python notebooks: [Hardware Performance](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance.ipynb).\\n\\n\\n### Time-series forecasting\\n\\nBuilding forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. You can use automated ML to combine techniques and approaches and get a recommended, high-quality time-series forecast. You can find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nAn automated time-series experiment is treated as a multivariate regression problem. Past time-series values are \\\"pivoted\\\" to become additional dimensions for the regressor together with other predictors. This approach, unlike classical time series methods, has an advantage of naturally incorporating multiple contextual variables and their relationship to one another during training. Automated ML learns a single, but often internally branched model for all items in the dataset and prediction horizons. More data is thus available to estimate model parameters and generalization to unseen series becomes possible.\\n\\nAdvanced forecasting configuration includes:\\n* holiday detection and featurization\\n* time-series and DNN learners (Auto-ARIMA, Prophet, ForecastTCN)\\n* many models support through grouping\\n* rolling-origin cross validation\\n* configurable lags\\n* rolling window aggregate features\\n\\nSee an example of forecasting and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Energy Demand](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand-advanced.ipynb).\\n\\n### Computer vision\\n\\nSupport for computer vision tasks allows you to easily generate models trained on image data for scenarios like image classification and object detection. \\n\\nWith this capability you can: \\n \\n* Seamlessly integrate with the [Azure Machine Learning data labeling](.\/how-to-create-image-labeling-projects.md) capability\\n* Use labeled data for generating image models\\n* Optimize model performance by specifying the model algorithm and tuning the hyperparameters. \\n* Download or deploy the resulting model as a web service in Azure Machine Learning. \\n* Operationalize at scale, leveraging Azure Machine Learning [MLOps](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) and [ML Pipelines](concept-ml-pipelines.md) capabilities.\", \"document.score\": 0.02497858926653862, \"document.metadata\": {\"id\": \"Y29uY2VwdC1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtbWwubWQx\", \"source\": {\"title\": \"What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\", \"filename\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\", \"url\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\", \"mtime\": 1710206108.0}, \"stats\": {\"tiktokens\": 920, \"chars\": 4752, \"lines\": 52}, \"content_hash\": \"809c865d2d03bfc9f56027491f6ca2dbcbb708f8b1a18a52b147070b31c6f767\"}}]"},"events":[],"links":[],"resource":{"attributes":{"service.name":"promptflow"},"schema_url":""}}],"contentrange":"bytes 0-15726/15727","correlationid":"8f251938-3aab-4489-b0a8-8ac104c3a19d","xrequestid":"8f251938-3aab-4489-b0a8-8ac104c3a19d","agent":"azureml-ai-monitoring/0.1.0b4","modelversion":"default","collectdatatype":"pandas.core.frame.DataFrame"}

Azure Machine Learning offers featurizations specifically for these tasks, such as deep neural network text featurizers for classification. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nThe main goal of classification models is to predict which categories new data will fall into based on learnings from its training data. Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\n\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\n\\n### Regression\\n\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task. Azure Machine Learning offers featurization specific to regression problems. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nDifferent from classification where predicted output values are categorical, regression models predict numerical output values based on independent predictors. In regression, the objective is to help establish the relationship among those independent predictor variables by estimating how one variable impacts the others. For example, automobile price based on features like, gas mileage, safety rating, etc. \\n\\nSee an example of regression and automated machine learning for predictions in these Python notebooks: [Hardware Performance](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance.ipynb).\\n\\n\\n### Time-series forecasting\\n\\nBuilding forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. You can use automated ML to combine techniques and approaches and get a recommended, high-quality time-series forecast. You can find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nAn automated time-series experiment is treated as a multivariate regression problem. Past time-series values are \\\"pivoted\\\" to become additional dimensions for the regressor together with other predictors. This approach, unlike classical time series methods, has an advantage of naturally incorporating multiple contextual variables and their relationship to one another during training. Automated ML learns a single, but often internally branched model for all items in the dataset and prediction horizons. More data is thus available to estimate model parameters and generalization to unseen series becomes possible.\\n\\nAdvanced forecasting configuration includes:\\n* holiday detection and featurization\\n* time-series and DNN learners (Auto-ARIMA, Prophet, ForecastTCN)\\n* many models support through grouping\\n* rolling-origin cross validation\\n* configurable lags\\n* rolling window aggregate features\\n\\nSee an example of forecasting and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Energy Demand](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand-advanced.ipynb).\\n\\n### Computer vision\\n\\nSupport for computer vision tasks allows you to easily generate models trained on image data for scenarios like image classification and object detection. \\n\\nWith this capability you can: \\n \\n* Seamlessly integrate with the [Azure Machine Learning data labeling](.\/how-to-create-image-labeling-projects.md) capability\\n* Use labeled data for generating image models\\n* Optimize model performance by specifying the model algorithm and tuning the hyperparameters. \\n* Download or deploy the resulting model as a web service in Azure Machine Learning. \\n* Operationalize at scale, leveraging Azure Machine Learning [MLOps](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) and [ML Pipelines](concept-ml-pipelines.md) capabilities.\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"id\": \"Y29uY2VwdC1hdXRvbWF0ZWQtbWwubWQx\",\n      \"source\": {\n        \"title\": \"What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\",\n        \"filename\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\",\n        \"url\": \"concept-automated-ml.md\",\n        \"mtime\": 1710206108.0\n      },\n      \"stats\": {\n        \"tiktokens\": 920,\n        \"chars\": 4752,\n        \"lines\": 52\n      },\n      \"content_hash\": \"809c865d2d03bfc9f56027491f6ca2dbcbb708f8b1a18a52b147070b31c6f767\"\n    },\n    \"score\": 0.02497858926653862\n  }\n]"},"events":[{"name":"promptflow.function.inputs","timestamp":"2024-04-11T18:06:57.603959Z","attributes":{"payload":"{\n  \"mlindex_content\": \"embeddings:\\n  api_base: https:\/\/azureml-rag-auseast.openai.azure.com\/\\n  api_type: Azure\\n  api_version: 2023-07-01-preview\\n  batch_size: '16'\\n  connection:\\n    id: \\n      \/subscriptions\/1aefdc5e-3a7c-4d71-a9f9-f5d3b03be19a\/resourceGroups\/yuachengtestrg\/providers\/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices\/workspaces\/ai-proj-eastus\/connections\/Default_AzureOpenAI\\n  connection_type: workspace_connection\\n  deployment: text-embedding-ada-002\\n  dimension: 1536\\n  file_format_version: '2'\\n  kind: open_ai\\n  model: text-embedding-ada-002\\n  schema_version: '2'\\nindex:\\n  api_version: 2023-07-01-preview\\n  connection:\\n    id: \\n      \/subscriptions\/1aefdc5e-3a7c-4d71-a9f9-f5d3b03be19a\/resourceGroups\/yuachengtestrg\/providers\/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices\/workspaces\/ai-proj-eastus\/connections\/AzureAISearch\\n  connection_type: workspace_connection\\n  endpoint: https:\/\/yuacheng-aisearch-eastus.search.windows.net\\n  engine: azure-sdk\\n  field_mapping:\\n    content: content\\n    embedding: contentVector\\n    filename: filepath\\n    metadata: meta_json_string\\n    title: title\\n    url: url\\n  index: aml-rag-doc\\n  kind: acs\\n  semantic_configuration_name: azureml-default\\nself:\\n  path: \\n    azureml:\/\/subscriptions\/1aefdc5e-3a7c-4d71-a9f9-f5d3b03be19a\/resourcegroups\/yuachengtestrg\/workspaces\/ai-proj-eastus\/datastores\/workspaceblobstore\/paths\/azureml\/c258bd68-edde-4fbb-8333-d53f35698512\/index\/\\n  asset_id: \\n    azureml:\/\/locations\/eastus\/workspaces\/38bb01fe-e2e1-4e40-9af9-a9ff97fdcd6d\/data\/aml-rag-doc\/versions\/1\\n\",\n  \"queries\": \"What does AML stand for?\",\n  \"query_type\": \"Hybrid (vector + keyword)\",\n  \"top_k\": 3\n}"}},{"name":"promptflow.function.output","timestamp":"2024-04-11T18:07:03.875338Z","attributes":{"payload":"[\n  {\n    \"text\": \"# What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\\n\\n---\\ntitle: What is automated ML?

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality.

The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score.

It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. \\n\\nUsing **Azure Machine Learning**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, regression, computer vision or NLP.\\n\\n1. **Choose whether you want a code-first experience or a no-code studio web experience**: Users who prefer a code-first experience can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDKv2](how-to-configure-auto-train.md) or the [Azure Machine Learning CLIv2](how-to-train-cli.md).

Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\n\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\n\\n### Regression\\n\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task.

You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nDifferent from classification where predicted output values are categorical, regression models predict numerical output values based on independent predictors. In regression, the objective is to help establish the relationship among those independent predictor variables by estimating how one variable impacts the others. For example, automobile price based on features like, gas mileage, safety rating, etc. \\n\\nSee an example of regression and automated machine learning for predictions in these Python notebooks: [Hardware Performance](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance.ipynb).\\n\\n\\n### Time-series forecasting\\n\\nBuilding forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. You can use automated ML to combine techniques and approaches and get a recommended, high-quality time-series forecast. You can find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nAn automated time-series experiment is treated as a multivariate regression problem. Past time-series values are \\\"pivoted\\\" to become additional dimensions for the regressor together with other predictors. This approach, unlike classical time series methods, has an advantage of naturally incorporating multiple contextual variables and their relationship to one another during training.

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML in Azure Machine Learning is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/research\/project\/automl\/).\\n\\n* For code-experienced customers, [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install).  Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model (preview) with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md).\\n\\n\\n## How does AutoML work?\\n\\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The better the score for the metric you want to optimize for, the better the model is considered to \\\"fit\\\" your data.  It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. \\n\\nUsing **Azure Machine Learning**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, regression, computer vision or NLP.\\n\\n1. **Choose whether you want a code-first experience or a no-code studio web experience**: Users who prefer a code-first experience can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDKv2](how-to-configure-auto-train.md) or the [Azure Machine Learning CLIv2](how-to-train-cli.md). Get started with [Tutorial: Train an object detection model with AutoML and Python](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md). Users who prefer a limited\/no-code experience can use the [web interface](how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models.md) in Azure Machine Learning studio at [https:\/\/ml.azure.com](https:\/\/ml.azure.com\/).  Get started with [Tutorial: Create a classification model with automated ML in Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml.md).\\n    \\n1. **Specify the source of the labeled training data**: You can bring your data to Azure Machine Learning in [many different ways](concept-data.md).\\n\\n1. **Configure the automated machine learning parameters** that determine how many iterations over different models, hyperparameter settings, advanced preprocessing\/featurization, and what metrics to look at when determining the best model.  \\n1. **Submit the training job.**\\n\\n1. **Review the results** \\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates this process. \\n![Automated Machine learning](.\/media\/concept-automated-ml\/automl-concept-diagram2.png)\\n\\n\\nYou can also inspect the logged job information, which [contains metrics](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md) gathered during the job. The training job produces a Python serialized object (`.pkl` file) that contains the model and data preprocessing.\\n\\nWhile model building is automated, you can also [learn how important or relevant features are](.\/v1\/how-to-configure-auto-train.md?view=azureml-api-1\u0026preserve-view=true#explain) to the generated models.\\n\\n## When to use AutoML: classification, regression, forecasting, computer vision \u0026 NLP\\n\\nApply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify. Automated ML democratizes the machine learning model development process, and empowers its users, no matter their data science expertise, to identify an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for any problem.\\nSource: concept-automated-ml.md\\n\\nContent: # What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\n---\\ntitle: What is Azure Machine Learning?\\ndescription: 'Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.'\\nservices: machine-learning\\nms.service: machine-learning\\nms.subservice: core\\nms.topic: overview\\nauthor: frogglew\\nms.author: saoh\\nms.reviewer: sgilley\\nms.date: 09\/22\/2022\\nms.custom:\\n  - event-tier1-build-2022\\n  - ignite-2022\\n  - build-2023\\n  - build-2023-dataai\\n  - ignite-2023\\nadobe-target: true\\n---\\n\\n# What is Azure Machine Learning?\\n\\nAzure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle.

Whether you're running rapid experiments, hyperparameter-tuning, building pipelines, or managing inferences, you can use familiar interfaces including:\\n\\n* [Azure Machine Learning studio](https:\/\/ml.azure.com)\\n* [Python SDK (v2)](https:\/\/aka.ms\/sdk-v2-install)\\n* [Azure CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md))\\n* [Azure Resource Manager REST APIs](\/rest\/api\/azureml\/)\\n\\nAs you're refining the model and collaborating with others throughout the rest of the Machine Learning development cycle, you can share and find assets, resources, and metrics for your projects on the Machine Learning studio UI.\\n\\n### Studio\\n\\n[Machine Learning studio](https:\/\/ml.azure.com) offers multiple authoring experiences depending on the type of project and the level of your past ML experience, without having to install anything.\\n\\n* **Notebooks**: Write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.\\n* **Visualize run metrics**: Analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.\\n\\n    :::image type=\\\"content\\\" source=\\\"media\/how-to-log-view-metrics\/metrics.png\\\" alt-text=\\\"Screenshot that shows metrics for a training run.\\\":::\\nSource: overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md\\n\\nContent: # What is automated machine learning (AutoML)?\\n\\nML professionals and developers across industries can use automated ML to:\\n+ Implement ML solutions without extensive programming knowledge\\n+ Save time and resources\\n+ Leverage data science best practices\\n+ Provide agile problem-solving\\n\\n### Classification\\n\\nClassification is a type of supervised learning in which models learn using training data, and apply those learnings to new data. Azure Machine Learning offers featurizations specifically for these tasks, such as deep neural network text featurizers for classification. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nThe main goal of classification models is to predict which categories new data will fall into based on learnings from its training data. Common classification examples include fraud detection, handwriting recognition, and object detection. \\n\\nSee an example of classification and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Bank Marketing](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing\/automl-classification-task-bankmarketing.ipynb).\\n\\n### Regression\\n\\nSimilar to classification, regression tasks are also a common supervised learning task. Azure Machine Learning offers featurization specific to regression problems. Learn more about [featurization options](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#data-featurization). You can also find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nDifferent from classification where predicted output values are categorical, regression models predict numerical output values based on independent predictors. In regression, the objective is to help establish the relationship among those independent predictor variables by estimating how one variable impacts the others. For example, automobile price based on features like, gas mileage, safety rating, etc. \\n\\nSee an example of regression and automated machine learning for predictions in these Python notebooks: [Hardware Performance](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance\/automl-regression-task-hardware-performance.ipynb).\\n\\n\\n### Time-series forecasting\\n\\nBuilding forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. You can use automated ML to combine techniques and approaches and get a recommended, high-quality time-series forecast. You can find the list of algorithms supported by AutoML [here](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#supported-algorithms). \\n\\nAn automated time-series experiment is treated as a multivariate regression problem. Past time-series values are \\\"pivoted\\\" to become additional dimensions for the regressor together with other predictors. This approach, unlike classical time series methods, has an advantage of naturally incorporating multiple contextual variables and their relationship to one another during training. Automated ML learns a single, but often internally branched model for all items in the dataset and prediction horizons. More data is thus available to estimate model parameters and generalization to unseen series becomes possible.\\n\\nAdvanced forecasting configuration includes:\\n* holiday detection and featurization\\n* time-series and DNN learners (Auto-ARIMA, Prophet, ForecastTCN)\\n* many models support through grouping\\n* rolling-origin cross validation\\n* configurable lags\\n* rolling window aggregate features\\n\\nSee an example of forecasting and automated machine learning in this Python notebook: [Energy Demand](https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azureml-examples\/blob\/main\/sdk\/python\/jobs\/automl-standalone-jobs\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand\/automl-forecasting-task-energy-demand-advanced.ipynb).\\n\\n### Computer vision\\n\\nSupport for computer vision tasks allows you to easily generate models trained on image data for scenarios like image classification and object detection. \\n\\nWith this capability you can: \\n \\n* Seamlessly integrate with the [Azure Machine Learning data labeling](.\/how-to-create-image-labeling-projects.md) capability\\n* Use labeled data for generating image models\\n* Optimize model performance by specifying the model algorithm and tuning the hyperparameters. \\n* Download or deploy the resulting model as a web service in Azure Machine Learning. \\n* Operationalize at scale, leveraging Azure Machine Learning [MLOps](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) and [ML Pipelines](concept-ml-pipelines.md) capabilities.\\nSource: concept-automated-ml.md \\n\\n chat history: \\nuser: what is aml? \\nassistant:\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"temperature\": 1.0,\n  \"top_p\": 1.0,\n  \"n\": 1,\n  \"stream\": false,\n  \"presence_penalty\": 0.0,\n  \"frequency_penalty\": 0.0,\n  \"user\": \"\"\n}"}},{"name":"promptflow.llm.generated_message","timestamp":"2024-04-11T18:07:12.008325Z","attributes":{"payload":"{\n  \"content\": \"Azure Machine Learning (AML) is a cloud service used for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle.
