  Subject: Request for Refund of Recent Book Purchase
  Dear [Business Name],
  I am writing to request a refund for the books I purchased from your store last week. Unfortunately, the books did not meet my expectations, and I would like to return them for a full refund.
  I have attached a copy of the purchase receipt to this email as proof of purchase. The books are in their original packaging and have not been used, so I hope that the refund process will be straightforward.
  Please let me know what steps I need to take to return the books and receive a refund. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
  Sincerely,
  [Your Name]
