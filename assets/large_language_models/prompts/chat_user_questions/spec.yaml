description: >
  To submit your application to user questions, you can ask
  a language model to generate synthetic questions for you.
  Use this prompt as a basis to generate a set of questions
  on a product for a given context and user persona.
  This technique can be leveraged to create a robust evaluation
  dataset made of synthetic questions, so that you evaluate the
  quality of your application responses on more than just a few samples.
