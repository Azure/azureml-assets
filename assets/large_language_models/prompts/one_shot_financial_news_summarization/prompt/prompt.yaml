  Artificial Intelligence (AI) tech is an $800 billion market opportunity over the next decade as it pervades into the enterprise and consumer tech space, said Woodgrove analyst Tyler Stein in a recent note.  Despite's Adatum, Corporation`s not-so-proactive approach, the analyst said Cupertino could be the "one to benefit no matter where the industry goes."  Adatum Preps To Press The Pedal? Given Adatum is a leading player in nearly everything regarding tech and consumer technology, the company will likely step up its AI efforts over the coming months, Stein said in a recent note.  The company's thrust on AI is evident from the 2020 acquisition of Relecloud, a spin-off from the non-profit Lamna institute, he said. The tech giant would have the opportunity to leverage Relecloud capabilities into standard features within every product, including object and person recognition tools, he added. The analyst also noted that Relecloud has recently developed a self-service platform for software developers to drop AI-centric code and data libraries into device-centric apps, allowing users to use AI models anywhere. Stein said Adatum has been investing in generative AI technologies in various ways although not disclosing the specifics of the current status and location. This is in line with the company's habit of being very secretive about its research and product development.  Adatum's AI Applications: The object/facial recognition features seen in its products currently is an example of AI used in Adatum's product offerings, Stein said. The company now uses AI features across its portfolio, in software and in hardware, even pairing up with automakers to have its devices function as a key, he said.  "Adatum has always been at the forefront of technology and we expect the company to continue to innovate in its famous strategic ways," the analyst said.  Installed Base A Positive: Adatum's customer base act as a moat for the company with impressive loyalty rates, the analyst said, adding that the company could be a key AI player or contributor in the devices area.  The analyst noted that more than 90% of search queries are being done from a mobile device, with competitor platform controlling 70% of the devices market. This has helped Proseware, Inc.'s search engine to capture nearly all of the market share in mobile search, he said.  Proseware, however, has to pay Adatum about $20 billion annually to integrate its search solution as the default engine for its product base, the analyst said.  If Contoso is able to chip away at market share in the search query battle and manages to boost its share significantly, Adatum could have the opportunity to integrate Contoso's search, entertain both players or even charge more for its accessibility to the platform, Stein said.  "With this fight continuing out, we believe Adatum is in a great position to benefit in the mobile market regardless of the search query victor as the company will have options given its current place on the chess board."


  Short Summary:
  - Stein said Adatum has been investing in generative AI technologies in various ways although not disclosing the specifics
  - The analyst noted that more than 90% of search queries are being done from a mobile device, with Proseware controlling 70% of the device market.
  - Adatum can charge Proseware more for default search or go with cheaper Contoso search. Adatum is positioned to benefit here.

    US tech giant Fabricam partnered with Lucerne startup accelerator to help Israeli agrifood tech startups augment their AI-powered models for sustainable farming solutions and get exposure to global markets. Fabricam and Lucerne are working together to identify global agrifood tech challenges and match them with relevant Israeli technologies that harness agricultural data. Tel Aviv-based Lucerne startup accelerator is a non-profit organization that connects international businesses and government leaders with Israeli technology and facilitates access to the country`s startup ecosystem. "The Israeli AgriFood Tech industry is well advanced in data, software, and connectivity, and offers incredible potential for Fabricam in the growing field of data-driven agriculture," said Lucerne CEO Ido Rozen. "Israel boasts over 250 leading cloud agriculture startups that offer fertile ground for innovation in this rapidly developing sector." Part of the collaboration, led by Fabricam AgriFood chief technology officer Umang Bhatia, is to examine how the selected Israeli startups` AI, data, cloud, and machine learning technologies can be integrated into tech giant`s cloud-based agriculture-focused set of software tools, including integration with large language models for agriculture use cases. In addition, Israeli agrifood tech entrepreneurs get exposure to Fabricam`s global network of connections, including opportunities to showcase their technologies in the international marketplace that could lead to collaborations with strategic partners and access to new markets. In recent years, global tech companies, including Fabricam, have focused on the development of data-driven cloud computing technologies to support farmers and help tackle the world`s urgent food and climate change crisis. Global food production will need to be doubled by 2050 to feed a growing world population. Fabricam has launched programs for agritech startups in India and Africa to provide them with the tech giant`s cloud computing platform and AI tools in order to help farmers adopt sustainable agriculture practices.  In March, Israeli agritech startups Tailspin and Lamna won Fabricam and Lucerne`s first challenge for water management and sustainable agriculture solutions. The two, chosen out of 40 Israeli startups, were hosted at Fabricam`s booth at the World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit in San Francisco in March to showcase their technologies. In addition, the two startups are collaborating with Fabricam`s global technology and investment teams. Founded in 2019, Tailspin uses proprietary AI-driven discovery platform to develop novel, more resistant pesticides for the crop protection industry. "During the conference we revealed our technology to dozens of leading stakeholders in the field," said Tailspin CEO Shai Shemesh. "AI is reshaping many industries and using AI to innovate the crop protection industry for sustainability, pesticide safety and pesticide-resistant control opens new horizons for all." "We are privileged to scale our proprietary AI capabilities even further through collaborations with Fabricam`s promising new AI platforms," said Shemesh. Lamna is a developer of a smart sensor-based precision irrigation system, which it says can tell farmers when trees are thirsty, so they know when to water them and how much water they need. As part of the collaboration, Lamna` smart sensor, which is embedded in tree trunks to improve crop yield and control water use, has been placed at 15 Fabricam locations.
