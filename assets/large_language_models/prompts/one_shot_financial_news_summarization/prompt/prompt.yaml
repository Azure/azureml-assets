    news article: Artificial Intelligence (AI) tech is an $800 billion market opportunity over the next decade as it pervades into the enterprise and consumer tech space, said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a recent note.  Despite's Apple, Inc.`s not-so-proactive approach, the analyst said Cupertino could be the "one to benefit no matter where the industry goes."  Apple Preps To Press The Pedal? Given Apple is a leading player in nearly everything regarding tech and consumer technology, the company will likely step up its AI efforts over the coming months, Ives said in a recent note.  The company's thrust on AI is evident from the 2020 acquisition of Xnor.ai, a spin-off from the non-profit Allen Institute for AI, he said. The tech giant would have the opportunity to leverage Xnor.ai capabilities into standard features within every iPhone, iPad and MacBook, including object and person recognition tools, he added. The analyst also noted that Xnor.ai has recently developed a self-service platform for software developers to drop AI-centric code and data libraries into device-centric apps, allowing users to use AI models anywhere. Ives said Apple has been investing in generative AI technologies in various ways although not disclosing the specifics of the current status and location. This is in line with the company's habit of being very secretive about its research and product development.  Apple's AI Applications: The object/facial recognition features seen in iPhones currently is an example of AI used in Apple's product offerings, Ives said. The company now uses AI features across its portfolio, ranging from Siri to hardware, even pairing up with automakers to have its phone function as a key, he said.  "Apple has always been at the forefront of technology and we expect the company to continue to innovate in its famous strategic ways," the analyst said.  Installed Base A Positive: Apple's customer base act as a moat for the company with impressive loyalty rates, the analyst said, adding that the company could be a key AI player or contributor in the iPhone area.  The analyst noted that more than 90% of search queries are being done from a mobile device, with Android controlling 70% of the smartphone market. This has helped Alphabet, Inc.'s  Google Search to capture nearly all of the market share in mobile search, he said.  Google, however, has to pay Apple about $20 billion annually to integrate Google Search as the default search engine for its product base, the analyst said.  If Microsoft Corp. is able to chip away at market share in the search query battle and manages to boost its share significantly, Apple could have the opportunity to integrate Bing, entertain both players or even charge more for its accessibility to the platform, Ive said.  "With this fight continuing out, we believe Apple is in a great position to benefit in the mobile market regardless of the search query victor as the company will have options given its current place on the chess board."

    US tech giant Microsoft has partnered with Start-Up Nation Central to help Israeli agrifood tech startups augment their AI-powered models for sustainable farming solutions and get exposure to global markets. Microsoft and Start-Up Nation Central are working together to identify global agrifood tech challenges and match them with relevant Israeli technologies that harness agricultural data. Tel Aviv-based Start-Up Nation Central is a non-profit organization that connects international businesses and government leaders with Israeli technology and facilitates access to the country`s startup ecosystem. "The Israeli AgriFood Tech industry is well advanced in data, software, and connectivity, and offers incredible potential for Microsoft in the growing field of data-driven agriculture," said Start-Up Nation Central CEO Avi Hasson. "Israel boasts over 250 leading cloud agriculture startups that offer fertile ground for innovation in this rapidly developing sector." Part of the collaboration, led by Microsoft AgriFood chief technology officer Ranveer Chandra, is to examine how the selected Israeli startups` AI, data, cloud, and machine learning technologies can be integrated into tech giant`s cloud-based agriculture-focused set of software tools, including Open AI integration with GPT-3 and ChatGPT for agriculture use cases. In addition, Israeli agrifood tech entrepreneurs get exposure to Microsoft`s global network of connections, including opportunities to showcase their technologies in the international marketplace that could lead to collaborations with strategic partners and access to new markets. In recent years, global tech companies, including Microsoft, have focused on the development of data-driven cloud computing technologies to support farmers and help tackle the world`s urgent food and climate change crisis. Global food production will need to be doubled by 2050 to feed a growing world population.Microsoft has launched programs for agritech startups in India and Africa to provide them with the tech giant`s cloud computing platform and AI tools in order to help farmers adopt sustainable agriculture practices.  In March, Israeli agritech startups Projini and Saturas won Microsoft and SNC`s first challenge for water management and sustainable agriculture solutions. The two, chosen out of 40 Israeli startups, were hosted at Microsoft`s booth at the World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit in San Francisco in March to showcase their technologies. In addition, the two startups are collaborating with Microsoft`s global technology and investment teams. Founded in 2019, Projini uses proprietary AI-driven discovery platform to develop novel, more resistant pesticides for the crop protection industry. "During the conference we revealed our technology to dozens of leading stakeholders in the field," said Projini CEO Dotan Peleg. "AI is reshaping many industries and using AI to innovate the crop protection industry for sustainability, pesticide safety and pesticide-resistant control opens new horizons for all." "We are privileged to scale our proprietary AI capabilities even further through collaborations with Microsoft`s promising new AI platforms," said Peleg. Saturas is a developer of a smart sensor-based precision irrigation system, which it says can tell farmers when trees are thirsty, so they know when to water them and how much water they need. As part of the collaboration, Saturas` smart sensor, which is embedded in tree trunks to improve crop yield and control water use, has been placed at 15 Microsoft locations.
