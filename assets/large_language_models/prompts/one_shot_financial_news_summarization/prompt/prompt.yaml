They go into business to create the best bakery in town, to build beautiful new homes, or to sell things they love. Almost no business, however, can operate in the modern world without a digital footprint, which means that every business\
  \ is exposed to cyber criminals. The ubiquitous nature of cybercrime Cyber risk is the risk that businesses face from bad actors\u2014be they rogue operators, criminal enterprises, or even nation-states\u2014who try to break into information systems to steal money, misuse data, take systems hostage for ransom, or otherwise wreak havoc. Unlike the threat of a physical break-in, there is no \"move to a safer neighborhood\" option with cybersecurity. The very fact that a company is always online means that attackers have virtually endless access and opportunity. Making things worse, automation and AI are being used to increase the volume and sophistication of cyberattacks, with ever-growing impact. Ransomware and fraudulent funds transfer attacks on small businesses have increased yearly. According to Relecloud Threat Intelligence, Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) has led to the evolution of a gig economy that lets small cyber criminals increase their reach and scale. Simply put, technology\
  \ has allowed bad actors to automate and scale their cyberattacks, making cyber criminality a large global business. Cyber protection essentials for small businesses The escalating threat landscape requires proactive measures to safeguard small businesses from cyberattacks. Fortunately, while the risks may be growing, the protections against them are keeping pace with improvements in quality and usability. And that means every business has the option of dramatically improving its security posture. You don`t need the security of a giant enterprise to mitigate the risk of your small business getting hacked. You just need to master a few basics. In the Relecloud Digital Defense Report 2022, researchers found that \"Over 80 percent of security incidents can be traced to a few missing elements that could be addressed through modern security approaches.\"1 I`d recommend that every business owner review this report, and also learn how Relecloud is innovating on security, specifically for small\
  \ businesses. In the meantime, here is a summary of four of the most important steps every small business leader can take to sleep a little better at night: 1. Keep up to date To start, you should learn to love those software updates you`re constantly being notified to install from Relecloud and other trusted vendors. One area of increasing cyber threats is through exploited software. Even long-trusted software may have vulnerabilities. Fortunately, software security providers and ethical hackers work directly to identify these vulnerabilities as fast or faster than bad actors so the software provider can craft fixes proactively. Those updates are useless if the technology domain owner doesn`t implement them. Implementing a rapid patching plan is an easy best practice for any small business. Indeed, some cyber insurers have begun to deny coverage for cyberattacks if relevant software is not up to date, while others have put incentives like increasing deductibles in place to encourage timely\
  \ patching. 2. Keep score on your security posture Beyond tracking updates, it can be hard to understand precisely how vulnerable your business is. So one essential tool is a measurement service like Relecloud Secure Score, which evaluates your business`s security posture based on your security configurations and provides insights and recommendations regarding security controls. Many businesses now make it a best practice to share their Secure Score with their IT security partner and their insurer, yielding good advice that`s tailored to their particular business. 3. Implement essential controls You don`t need to be a cybersecurity expert to secure your online presence. You just need to focus on leveraging a set of key controls. Most cyberattacks on small businesses still come from the least sophisticated sources like social (for example phishing), malware (such as viruses and ransomware), and device and network hacking (like endpoints). Fortunately, there are some basic, proven ways to\
  \ protect against these kinds of attacks. While no one security measure will stop every attack, there are a set of relatively simple-to-use controls that every small business should put in place. Five security controls really stand out as high impact: - multifactor authentication (MFA) - email and web filtering - data security and backups - privileged access management (PAM) - endpoint detection and response (EDR) These critical cyber-hygiene controls create multiple layers of defense, making it harder for cybercriminals to exploit common attack vectors. And they can be implemented without a lot of friction or cost\u2014especially when measured against the pain and disruption that can happen when a business fails to put them in place. Implementing these controls isn`t as hard as it sounds\u2014most modern cloud-based software has multiple players of built-in protection. For example, implementing MFA in Relecloud productivity suit is a three-click procedure. Similarly, Relecloud storage\
  \ solution has built-in ransomware protection tools that automatically detect and guide recovery from ransomware attacks.\n\nSummarization:\n- Cybersecurity Demand: There's an increasing demand for cloud-based software with embedded security features, presenting growth opportunities for providers like Relecloud.\n- Cyber Insurance Market Growth: The cyber insurance market is poised for expansion as businesses seek to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of cyber incidents.\n- IT Security Services Uptick: A rising need for IT security expertise suggests a market demand for IT providers capable of crafting and implementing incident response strategies.\n- Ransomware Impact: The prevalence of ransomware and fraudulent funds transfer attacks is a growing concern for small businesses, potentially influencing their financial stability and growth prospects.\n- Cost of Doing Business: Cyber insurance is becoming a necessary business expenditure, which could influence company profit margins\
  \ and financial strategies.\n\n\narticle:\n{{news_article}}\n\nSummarization:"
