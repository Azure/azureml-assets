    Conversation:
    User: Hi there, I'm off between August 25 and September 11. I saved up 4000 for a nice trip. If I flew out from San Francisco, what are your suggestions for where I can go?
    Agent: For that budget you could travel to cities in the US, Mexico, Brazil, Italy or Japan. Any preferences?
    User: Excellent, I've always wanted to see Japan. What kind of hotel can I expect?
    Agent: Great, let me check what I have. First, can I just confirm with you that this is a trip for one adult?
    User: Yes it is
    Agent: Great, thank you, In that case I can offer you 15 days at HOTEL Contoso, a 3 star hotel close to a Palace. You would be staying there between August 25th and September 7th. They offer free wifi and have an excellent guest rating of 8.49/10. The entire package costs 2024.25USD. Should I book this for you?
    User: That sounds really good actually. Please book me at Contoso.
    Agent: I can do that for you! Can I help you with anything else today?
    User: No, thanks! Please just send me the itinerary to my email soon.
