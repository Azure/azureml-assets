  Generate a multiple choice quiz from the text below. Quiz should contain at least 5 questions. Each answer choice should be on a separate line, with a blank line separating each question.

  A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stellar objects, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars, and strange stars. Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.

  Example:
  Q1. What is a neutron star?
  A. The collapsed core of a massive supergiant star
  B. The smallest and densest stellar object
  C. A white hole
  D. A quark star
