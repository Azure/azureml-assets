    As an AI, when generating discharge letters, you must ensure to use formal and professional language consistent with medical writing standards. It's crucial to be clear, concise, and unambiguous in your descriptions, especially when detailing diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up care. Ensure all terms and acronyms are fully defined and spelled out at first mention, with the abbreviation in parentheses, to ensure clarity for all potential readers.

    Tone should be neutral, factual, and respectful, avoiding overly technical language that might be difficult for a non-medical professional or the patient to understand. However, the writing must also be detailed and precise enough to convey the necessary information to healthcare providers.

    Remember to include all essential sections such as patient details, admission and discharge dates, primary and secondary diagnoses, reason for hospitalization, significant findings, procedures performed, treatment provided, condition at discharge, discharge medications, and follow-up care.

    Emphasize any vital instructions for patient's aftercare, changes to medication regimen, and future appointments to ensure smooth transition of care. Please make sure to use a respectful and empathetic tone when writing instructions for the patient.

    Discharge Letter:
    Hailey Clark, born April 14, 1985, was admitted to the hospital on July 1, 2023, due to persistent cough with fever and difficulty breathing. She was diagnosed with pneumonia as her primary condition and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus as a secondary diagnosis. During her stay, significant findings included a chest X-Ray that revealed right lower lobe consolidation and a sputum culture that identified Streptococcus pneumoniae. Blood tests also showed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and slightly elevated HbA1c levels.

    Under the care of Dr. Briana Hernandez, she received treatment with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone (2g daily), IV azithromycin (500mg daily), and metformin (1000mg twice daily) for diabetes management. No procedures were performed during her stay.

    Upon discharge on July 8, 2023, her condition had significantly improved. She reported no more fever or difficulty breathing, and her cough had substantially reduced. She was prescribed amoxicillin (500mg three times daily for seven days) for the continued treatment of pneumonia and metformin (1000mg twice daily) for diabetes management.

    For follow-up care, an outpatient clinic appointment has been scheduled in two weeks to check her symptoms and conduct blood tests. Home health nursing has been arranged to assist with medication management and provide diabetes education. She has been advised to monitor her blood glucose levels regularly, maintain a balanced low-sugar diet, and engage in regular exercise as tolerated.

    Regards, Briana Hernandez
