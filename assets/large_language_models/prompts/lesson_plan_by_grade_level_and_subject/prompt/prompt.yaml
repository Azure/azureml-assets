  - A bulleted list of learning outcomes

  - Material types suggestion (a video, presentation, or article) for learning the concepts (that I could search for)

  - A small group activity

  - A set of exit ticket prompts to assess student understanding. First prompt should check for basic understanding, second prompt should prompt students to think more deeply, and third prompt should push higher order thinking.
