# Version constraints used during conda env creation to enforce security patch floors.
# Notes:
# - Constraints do NOT install new packages. They only constrain versions for packages
#   that are already required (directly or transitively) by the environment.
# - Keep this list focused on vulnerable/transitive deps that frequently trigger alerts.
