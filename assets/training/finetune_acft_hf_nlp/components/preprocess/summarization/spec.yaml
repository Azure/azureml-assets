  # {`document_column`: "Cheryl Boone Isaacs said that the relationship with the accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was also under review.\nBrian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz were responsible for Sunday's mishap.\nLa La Land was mistakenly announced as the winner of the best picture award.\nThe team behind the film were in the middle of their speeches before it was revealed the accolade should have gone to Moonlight.\nIt has been described as the biggest mistake in 89 years of Academy Awards history.\nHow did the Oscars mistake happen?\nNine epic awards fails\nMr Cullinan mistakenly handed the wrong envelope to the two presenters.\nHe gave Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway the back-up envelope for best actress in a leading role - rather than the envelope which contained the name of the winner for the best film.\nPriceWaterhouseCoopers, which counts the votes and organises the envelopes, has apologised for the mix-up.\nMr Cullinan tweeted a picture of best actress winner Emma Stone minutes before handing the presenters the wrong envelope, and Ms Boone Isaacs blamed "distraction" for the error.", `summary_column`: "The two accountants responsible for muddling up the main award envelopes at Sunday's Oscars ceremony will not be employed to do the job again, the academy president has announced."]}
# For the above dataset pattern, `document_key` is document_column; `summary_key` is summary_column and `summarization_lang`: `en` for __t5__ family and `en_XX` for __mbart family__

# summarization_lang codes for T5, mbart and bart
# t5 - French (fr), German (de), Romanian (ro), English (en)
# mbart - Arabic (ar_AR), Czech (cs_CZ), German (de_DE), English (en_XX), Spanish (es_XX), Estonian (et_EE), Finnish (fi_FI), French (fr_XX), Gujarati (gu_IN), Hindi (hi_IN), Italian (it_IT), Japanese (ja_XX), Kazakh (kk_KZ), Korean (ko_KR), Lithuanian (lt_LT), Latvian (lv_LV), Burmese (my_MM), Nepali (ne_NP), Dutch (nl_XX), Romanian (ro_RO), Russian (ru_RU), Sinhala (si_LK), Turkish (tr_TR), Vietnamese (vi_VN), Chinese, Sim (zh_CN)

  document_key:
    type: string
    optional: false
    description: Key for input document in each example line

  summary_key:
    type: string
    optional: false
    description: Key for document summary in each example line

  summarization_lang:
    type: string
    optional: true
    description: The parameter should be an abbreviated/coded form of the language as understood by tokenizer. Please check the respective model's language codes while updating this information

  batch_size:
    type: integer
    min: 1
    optional: true
    default: 1000
    description: Number of examples to batch before calling the tokenization function

  # Tokenization params
  pad_to_max_length:
    type: string
    enum:
    - "true"
    - "false"
    default: "false"
    optional: true
    description: If set to True, the returned sequences will be padded according to the model's padding side and padding index, up to their `max_seq_length`. If no `max_seq_length` is specified, the padding is done up to the model's max length.

  max_seq_length:
    type: integer
    optional: true
    default: -1
    description: Controls the maximum length to use when pad_to_max_length parameter is set to `true`. Default is -1 which means the padding is done up to the model's max length. Else will be padded to `max_seq_length`.

  # Data inputs
  # Please note that either `train_file_path` or `train_mltable_path` needs to be passed. In case both are passed, `mltable path` will take precedence. The validation and test paths are optional and an automatic split from train data happens if they are not passed.
  # If both validation and test files are missing, 10% of train data will be assigned to each of them and the remaining 80% will be used for training
  # If anyone of the file is missing, 20% of the train data will be assigned to it and the remaining 80% will be used for training
