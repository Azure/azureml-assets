    description: The string can be any valid Hugging Face id from the [Hugging Face models webpage](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=summarization&sort=downloads). Models from Hugging Face are subject to third party license terms available on the Hugging Face model details page. It is your responsibility to comply with the model's license terms.

  # PyTorch model as input
  # This is nothing but huggingface model folder. Here's the link to the example model folder - [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased/tree/main). Additionally, the model folder **MUST** contain the file `finetune_args.json` with *model_name_or_path* as one of the keys of the dictionary

  # MLflow model as an input
  # This is also a huggingface model folder expect that the folder structure is slightly different. You could invoke a model import pipeline to convert the standard huggingface model into MLflow format. Please refer to this [notebook](https://aka.ms/azureml-import-model) for steps to do the same
  # NOTE The pytorch_model_path take priority over mlflow_model_path, in case both inputs are passed
