    Even if the requested output format is not strictly followed, extract the answer based on static
    patterns and match the extracted answer (A, B, C, D) to the reference choice.

    Steps:
        Split the model’s full prediction text into individual lines.
        Inspect the last line:
            If it contains “Answer”, strip out everything before the actual answer
            and clean up whitespace and punctuation.
        If the last line does not include “Answer”, search the prediction text for these markers:
            “Final Answer”
            “<answer>”
            “<|begin_of_solution|>”
        For each marker, find its last occurrence,
        grab up to 250 characters immediately after it to avoid overly long context, and clean that snippet.
        If no markers appear, clean up the last line.
        Once you have a candidate answer string:
            If it matches the pattern “[A-D].”, discard the dot and keep only the letter.
            If the result is not one of “A”, “B”, “C”, or “D”, return False.
        Compare the cleaned-up answer letter to the reference label and return True if they match,
        otherwise return False.

    Args:
        pred (str): The raw model prediction text.
        ref (str): The reference answer choice (one of "A", "B", "C", "D").

    Returns:
