{"article":"Hundreds of tourists had to be evacuated from Warwick Castle after a flaming cannonball set alight to a medieval thatched building during a display. Holidaymakers, many with young children enjoying the last day of the Easter break, had gathered to watch the cannonball be fired from the wooden trebuchet \u2013 the largest working siege machine in the world. However, the big display ended in catastrophe when sparks from the fireball ignited the roof of a nearby ancient boathouse, causing it to erupt into flames.

Holidaymakers watched in horror as  a cannonball fired from a wooden trebuchet \u2013 the largest working siege machine in the world - struck a medieval thatched boathouse overlooking the River Avon at Warwick Castle . Witness Heather Taylor, 42, who had travelled from Birmingham with her six-year-old son Ethan to watch the cannonball launch, described the panic as the incident unfolded. She said: 'The trebuchet launched the flaming cannonball but as it flew almost over the boathouse sparks could clearly be seen coming off it and the high winds must have sent them onto the roof of the boathouse. 'There was a lot of panic and people were scrambling up the bank because they had no idea if the fire would spread. 'The place was packed with lots of young children and families. We were all evacuated and it was quite scary. 'It was shocking how fast the fire took hold. 'The cannonball actually appeared to land behind the boat house but it was obviously too close. 'It's such a shame because the boathouse has only just been re-thatched and we watched a chap thatching it before the big show. It's a medieval building so it's a big loss.' The catapult display ended in catastrophe when sparks from the cannonball ignited the roof of the ancient boathouse, causing it to erupt into flames at about 5.45pm. It forced an evacuated at the Warwick attraction . Video footage shows the medieval boathouse engulfed in flames after the flaming cannonball apparently set it alight yesterday afternoon. Warwick Castle said the attraction remains open today despite the incident . The thatched boathouse, which overlooks the River Avon within the castle grounds in Warwickshire (pictured above before the blaze), was unoccupied at the time and has now been completely destroyed by the flames . Up to 30 firefighters attended the incident and fire chiefs confirmed no one was injured by the blaze. The main castle was also unaffected by the fire. A Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'We received a call at 5.47pm to a fire at the boathouse in the grounds of Warwick Castle. 'Three appliances were sent to the fire.' The historic boathouse, which was completely destroyed as a result of the fire, dates back to 1896. The 5th Earl, Frances Greville, had it built to house an electric boat which he powered by batteries charged from the electricity generated by the castle's mill. The trebuchet which fired the flaming cannonball stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes. A flaming cannonball was launched from this wooden\u00a0trebuchet, which stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes, during a demonstration to show how the machine was used to hurl huge projectiles to breach the castle walls . The fire forced hundreds of tourists to be evacuated from Warwick Castle (above) at about 5.45pm yesterday . Warwick Castle confirmed the incident and said the attraction remains open and unaffected. A spokesman said: 'We did experience a fire in our boathouse yesterday which was safely extinguished within a short time. 'The island where the boathouse is located was not open to the public at the time and no-one was ever at any risk; nor did it affect any other part of the castle. 'We'd like to take this opportunity to thank Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service for their prompt assistance. 'Despite speculation we have not yet ascertained the cause of the fire. A full investigation is underway. 'The castle will be fully open today featuring our spectacular Easter events programme.' The trebuchet, which is 60ft tall and weighs 22 tonnes, was used to hurl projectiles at the castle . The wooden trebuchet is the largest working siege machine in the world and is effectively a colossal catapult. It is a recreation of one of the biggest and most deadly military machines of all times, which was used as a weapon for protection. The trebuchet, which stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes, was used to hurl huge projectiles to breach the castle walls. Large rocks and stones were the main ammunition but there is evidence of more unusual material used such as large flaming cannonballs. Manure and dead animals were also hurled by the machine into the besieged castle to spread disease, with pigs among the top choice of animals to be fired. The trebuchet at Warwick Castle is an authentic recreation by Dr Peter Vemming, from The Mediaeval Centre in Nykobing, Denmark. Notes and drawings from the 13th century were used as the starting point for the reconstruction and were often referred to during the process of developing the working replica of the powerful machine. The trebuchet, which was built at a workshop in Wiltshire, is made primarily of oak with the long throwing arm made of ash and metal fixings holding it together. - Warwick Castle .","highlights":"Holidaymakers\u00a0watched in horror as ancient boathouse erupted into flames .\nSparks from flaming cannonball fired from  wooden trebuchet caused blaze .\nTourists evacuated from Warwick Castle as thatched building burnt down .\nNo one injured in incident which occurred on last day of Easter holidays .","id":"417326884e5ec35e711ce3740f1972915a3751e1","prediction":["This article discusses an incident at Warwick Castle where a flaming cannonball was fired during a display.

{"article":"A man appeared in court today charged with the murder of Syrian preacher\u00a0Abdul Hadi Arwani, who was found dead in his car in Wembley last week. The Crown Prosecution Service announced today that 36-year-old Leslie Cooper would be charged over the suspected murder of Mr Arwani, 48, who was an outspoken opponent of the Assad regime in his native country. He appeared before magistrates in Camberwell today for a brief hearing, and will appear at the Old Bailey later this week . Meanwhile, Scotland Yard said tonight that a second man, aged 61, had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Mr Arwani. Charge: A man has been charged with the murder of Syrian imam Abdul Hadi Arwani . The imam ran a building company as well as preaching at various mosques before he was shot dead and his body abandoned in a Volkswagen Passat last Tuesday night. Cooper, from Brent in north-west London, was remanded in custody by a judge at Camberwell Magistrates' Court\u00a0and ordered to appear at the Old Bailey within the next 48 hours. He wore a grey tracksuit during the minute-long hearing, and spoke only to confirm his name. Earlier, the CPS said in a statement: 'The Crown Prosecution Service has today authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Leslie Cooper, 36, with the murder of Abdul Hadi Arwani. Mr Arwani was shot dead in the Greenhill area of London on April 7, 2015. Mosque: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An Noor mosque and cultural centre in west London . Car: He was found dead in his black Volkswagen Passat in Wembley last Tuesday night . 'Mr Cooper now stands charged with a criminal offence and has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.' The family of Mr Arwani have thanked the community \u2018for the outpouring of support during this extremely difficult time\u2019. In a statement, released through Scotland Yard, Mr Arwani's son Murhaf said: \u2018We are touched to learn how many people my father helped, advised and inspired in his short life.\u2019 Mr Arwani also urged anyone who may be able to help with the investigation to come forward. He said: \u2018If anyone has any additional information that can help with the investigation, we urge you to please come forward and speak to the Metropolitan Police. \u2018Your co-operation will help us close this painful page and begin to move on with our lives, in the knowledge that the person who took away our father will be brought to justice and duly punished for this heinous crime.\u2019 A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Leslie Cooper, 36, of Brent, NW10 was charged on Tuesday, April 14 with the murder of Mr Arwani and has been remanded in custody to appear at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court at 14:00hrs this afternoon.' A post-mortem examination found that Mr Arwani, a father of six, died from gunshot wounds and counter-terrorism officers were tasked with investigating his murder. He was an imam at the An Noor mosque in Acton, west London, from 2005 to 2011, but left the institution after being embroiled in a row with other leading figures there. Mr Arwani was a passionate opponent of Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime, and supported the opposition seeking to unseat the dictator. He was apparently forced to flee his home country after he was caught taking photographs in the town of Hama, which was devastated by a government massacre in 1982. After he was found dead, Mr Arwani's family paid tribute to him calling him 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet', and called on members of the public to help find his killer. An Noor has been linked with extremism after a number of radical preachers were invited to speak there, but friends of Mr Arwani have insisted that he held moderate and pro-Western views.

{"article":"Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra at the centre of a double murder case. Timothy Crook is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles before dumping them. But the grey car he is accused of using to transport the bodies has been lost, Bristol Crown Court was told. Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra (similar to the one shown here) at the centre of a double murder case . Timothy Crook (pictured) is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles in a grey Nissan Micra . Sarah Jones, representing Crook, 50, said the blunder could have forensic consequences for his case. Crook is accused of killing his parents at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live. Ms Jones told Judge Neil Ford QC at a preliminary hearing: 'The car in which the bodies were transported to Lincoln has been lost. 'That may have forensic consequences. We have some forensic angles being looked at. 'I have simply been told the Crown don't know where the car is. If it is not available it would be of help to have an identical model. 'It was a particular model which we believe did not allow for the laying down of the back seats.' Crook is accused of killing his parents (pictured) at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live . Police said the car (similar to the one pictured) which Crook is said to have driven was not lost and was in the North of England . A spokeswoman for the CPS added: 'It's not us who lost the car. We don't investigate the case, we can't be in possession of the car.' Wiltshire Police said the car was not lost, but did not know where it was exactly. A spokesman said: 'The vehicle has not been lost, we understand it to be in the North of England. 'But I believe there was a conversation in court around whether or not it would need to be brought back for further forensics etc.' Crook appeared at the plea and case management hearing via video link from Rampton Hospital and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty to the two murder charges. He is accused of murdering both parents between July 6 and 12, 2007. Some 49 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial which is provisionally set to open on July 6 and last up to four weeks.

But the grey car he is accused of using to transport the bodies has been lost, Bristol Crown Court was told. Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra (similar to the one shown here) at the centre of a double murder case . Timothy Crook (pictured) is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles in a grey Nissan Micra .

Crook is accused of killing his parents at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live. Ms Jones told Judge Neil Ford QC at a preliminary hearing: 'The car in which the bodies were transported to Lincoln has been lost. 'That may have forensic consequences. We have some forensic angles being looked at. 'I have simply been told the Crown don't know where the car is. If it is not available it would be of help to have an identical model.

Police said the car (similar to the one pictured) which Crook is said to have driven was not lost and was in the North of England . A spokeswoman for the CPS added: 'It's not us who lost the car. We don't investigate the case, we can't be in possession of the car.' Wiltshire Police said the car was not lost, but did not know where it was exactly. A spokesman said: 'The vehicle has not been lost, we understand it to be in the North of England. 'But I believe there was a conversation in court around whether or not it would need to be brought back for further forensics etc.' Crook appeared at the plea and case management hearing via video link from Rampton Hospital and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty to the two murder charges. He is accused of murdering both parents between July 6 and 12, 2007. Some 49 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial which is provisionally set to open on July 6 and last up to four weeks.

{"article":"Harrowing images have emerged showing the seconds before a media activist was brutally murdered by militants loyal to the Islamic State in Syria. Taken on the frontline of fighting in the countryside outside the rebel-held city of Aleppo, the photos show a prisoner wearing an orange jumpsuit being forced to his knees before being shot. ISIS released the disturbing photographs on the same day as they bizarrely attempted to portray everyday life under the terror group's control as happy and carefree - distributing images of smiling farmers living near Aleppo who use Western technology to grow and harvest their abundant crops. Harrowing:\u00a0Taken on the frontline of fighting in the countryside outside the rebel-held city of Aleppo, the photos show a prisoner wearing an orange jumpsuit being forced to his knees before being shot . The  new ISIS photographs show the activists just moments before he was shot at point blank range . Images of the media activist's brutal execution were released by ISIS' Halab Media Centre, which operates in and around the city of Aleppo and has previously released sickening images and videos of the terror organisation murdering anybody who dares to oppose them. Brave activists operating on the ground in Syria have been hugely successful in helping to unite and inspire a resistance against the terror group by sharing images and reports of their atrocities online. Groups such as Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which operates in ISIS' de facto capital city, work undercover, secretly filming ISIS militants as they take part in near daily massacres. This has, however, made the activists a major target, with the terror group exacting bloody revenge on those found to be spreading information on their activities. Charged as spies, the campaigners face certain death - either by being shot at point-blank range or crucified in a public square. The activist seen in the latest ISIS photographs show him just\u00a0moments before his 'execution'. The fact he was forced to his knees and the presence of men standing around him wielding assault rifles has led analysts to believe his death was almost certainly by shooting, even though his moment of death is not shown and there are no images of his body. Moments from death: With his arms tightly bound behind his back with plastic handcuffs, blurry images show the victim being dragged through a public square by his heavily armed captors . Strange: ISIS released the disturbing execution photographs on the same day as they bizarrely attempted to portray everyday life under the terror group's control as happy and carefree - distributing images of smiling farmers living near Aleppo who use Western technology to grow and harvest their abundant crops . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian . Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren\u2019t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. With his arms tightly bound behind his back with plastic handcuffs, blurry images show the victim being dragged through a public square by his heavily armed captors. His name and the group he worked for are not known, but ISIS identified the man as a 'media activist' understood to have been murdered sometime earlier this week. The images emerged on the same day as ISIS made a bizarre attempt to portray themselves as a peace-loving group by distributing photos of smiling farmers harvesting their crops. Using Western-style crop-spraying equipment, a group of young men are seen in the fields happily picking cabbages while young boys load them on to the back of a lorry. The happy pastoral scene is in stark contrast to the campaign of rape and massacre ISIS has brought to vast stretches of the Syria and Iraq - where depraved extremists carry out daily atrocities in the name of the radical interpretation if Islam. The juxtaposing scenes emerged as Kurdish officials claimed ISIS militants were preparing for an attack on a city in north east Syria, near the border with Iraq, where the terror group remains a significant threat despite recent setbacks elsewhere in the two countries. Hasaka province in north east Syria is strategically important for all sides and borders ISIS-held territory in Iraq, where the group is back on the offensive after losing Tikrit earlier this month. Modern: Using Western-style crop-spraying equipment, a group of young men are seen in the fields happily picking cabbages while young boys load them on to the back of a lorry . At work: One the cabbages have been picked, young boys are seen loading them on to the back of a lorry . The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia has recorded significant victories against ISIS this year, driving it from the town of Kobane at the Turkish border and then taking two towns in Hasaka province with the help of a U.S.-led air campaign. But ISIS remains a danger, said Redur Xelil, YPG spokesman. Its targets include the provincial capital, Hasaka city, and the town of Tel Tamr, to the northwest. ISIS is still believed to be holding some 200 Assyrian Christians abducted in February from villages near Tel Tamr. 'South of Hasaka there are areas that Daesh controls entirely. There is a big Daesh mobilisation outside the city, and there are big fears of an attack on Hasaka city,' Xelil said in an interview from the city of Qamishli via Skype. Daesh is an Arabic name for ISIS, which calls itself Islamic State. For now, ISIS' priority is Tel Tamr, where it aims to cut a YPG supply route, he added. ISIS is 'trying to take big cities, to take the battle into cities' to mark it harder for the U.S.-led alliance to hit it, he said. The happy pastoral scene is in stark contrast to the campaign of rape and massacre ISIS has brought to vast stretches of the Syria and Iraq - where depraved extremists carry out atrocities in the name of  radical Islam . Claim: The news comes as ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) was reported to have been seriously injured in an airstrike. The militant is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source . Hasaka is home to many Syrians who have fled areas further west, including the country's second city Aleppo, Xelil said. The Syrian Observatory, which monitors the Syrian civil war, reports daily clashes between the YPG and ISIS fighters near Tel Tamr, and clashes between the Syrian military and ISIS in areas west and east of Hasaka city. The YPG has emerged as the only partner for the U.S.-led alliance bombing ISIS in Syria. But its effectiveness is greatly diminished beyond areas where the Kurds have set up autonomous zones since Syria's conflict erupted in 2011. The United States, rejecting any partnership with President Bashar al-Assad against ISIS, is about to launch a programme to train and equip members of the mainstream Syrian opposition in order to fight the jihadists elsewhere. Xelil said the YPG had not been consulted on the programme, adding that its requests for military supplies remained unmet.","highlights":"Campaigner was photographed moments before his murder in rural Aleppo .\nForced to his knees and shot at point-blank range by rifle-wielding militants .\nMan is understood to have been an activist who secretly reported on ISIS .\nExecution images were released on same day as ISIS made bizarre attempt to portray life under the terror as a\u00a0pastoral\u00a0ideal with farmer photographs .","id":"9362b13f8a73d4a8181be3e52ec507eb60c49cb9","prediction":["This article discusses the brutal execution of a media activist by ISIS militants in Syria.

{"article":"A lawsuit filed by former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford attempting to have a judge order her kids to return to the U.S. from their father's custody in France has been dismissed once and for all. The case was dismissed with a court order stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids, son Hermes, 8, and daughter Helena, 5, to come back to the United States. Rutherford, 46, claims her children were illegally deported to France when a California Court awarded custody to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch, 40, and she pleaded for the order to be reversed. Scroll down for video . Kelly Rutherford, pictured with her children, Hermes and Helena, during a party in the Hamptons in August 2013, was shut down by the courts again in a final plea to gain custody of her children . Rutherford's lawsuit stating that her children were illegally deported from the United States was dismissed once and for all by a New York court . She claimed that no other U.S. court has ordered children to live in another country when they have an able parent in the United States. Giersch, who is a German citizen residing in France, was deported from the U.S. over allegations of visa fraud. But the dismissal of her case states that Rutherford failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in her custody dispute with Giersch. 'Petitioners allege that the California state court's custody order had the effect of deporting the children in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to remain in the United States,' the document reads. The document added: 'There is no authority establishing the unconditional right of minor children to reside in the United States when one of their custodial parents lives abroad. 'Likewise there is no \"plainly defined and peremptory duty\" requiring Respondents to interfere with the custody order - nor is there, as Petitioners contend, a general affirmative duty on federal agencies requiring them to intervene against what is claimed to be unconstitutional state action.' After divorcing in 2010, Rutherford and ex-husband Daniel Giersch went through a nasty custody battle which ended with Giersch being awarded custody while the children were to visit Rutherford on vacations . Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 . Further, the court states 'the children have not been deported; they retain their United States citizenship and, once they reach the age of majority, they will be free to choose where to reside. 'There is, therefore, no non-frivolous constitutional question, only an attempt to seek federal judicial intervention in a state court custody dispute' The order affirmed the original order and said it would be improper for the federal court to intervene in Rutherford's custody battle. Because of this, there will be no intervention and the appeal will be dismissed. A California court ruled two years ago that the children should live in France with ex-husband Daniel Griesch, who she divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage. Rutherford has said that the court in Monaco, where Giersch lives, decided on a new custody order that lets her only see her children on holiday and during the summer. It has left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $2million in debt after spending all her earnings from Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children. In it's dismissal of her case, the court said it failed to\u00a0argue why the federal court should intervene in the custody dispute . Daily Mail Online revealed in August that Rutherford had filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of herself and her children. She sued the U.S. government, including Attorney General Holder and Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues. She wanted the US District Court in New York court to grant her \u2018temporary emergency authority\u2019 over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was \u2018unconstitutional\u2019. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said on November 24 that Rutherford's case was nothing more than her being dissatisfied with the result of the child-custody proceeding. The departments demanded on that her appeal be dismissed and said she's forcing the departments to become part of something they were never involved in. Rutherford argued her case in a New York court on March 18, but the appeal court shut down her plea and ordered the original order to remain in place.","highlights":"She claims a California judge deported her children illegally in 2012 .\nCalifornia court ruled Rutherford's ex-husband Daniel Giersch could take the children to live in France and spend vacations with in the US .\nHer petition to custody battle was dismissed in court last August .\nBut in one final attempt she put in another appeal, which was dismissed .\nCourt order states that it did'nt have jurisdiction to force kids to live in US .\nThe permanent dismissal says that Rutherford failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in custody case .","id":"63c81e1dfdf33d73c1d00b2e3397cdd46d7b3fa9","prediction":["This article discusses the ongoing custody dispute between former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford and her ex-husband Daniel Giersch.

The case was dismissed with a court order stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids, son Hermes, 8, and daughter Helena, 5, to come back to the United States. Rutherford, 46, claims her children were illegally deported to France when a California Court awarded custody to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch, 40, and she pleaded for the order to be reversed. Scroll down for video . Kelly Rutherford, pictured with her children, Hermes and Helena, during a party in the Hamptons in August 2013, was shut down by the courts again in a final plea to gain custody of her children . Rutherford's lawsuit stating that her children were illegally deported from the United States was dismissed once and for all by a New York court . She claimed that no other U.S. court has ordered children to live in another country when they have an able parent in the United States. Giersch, who is a German citizen residing in France, was deported from the U.S. over allegations of visa fraud. But the dismissal of her case states that Rutherford failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in her custody dispute with Giersch. 'Petitioners allege that the California state court's custody order had the effect of deporting the children in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to remain in the United States,' the document reads. The document added: 'There is no authority establishing the unconditional right of minor children to reside in the United States when one of their custodial parents lives abroad. 'Likewise there is no \"plainly defined and peremptory duty\" requiring Respondents to interfere with the custody order - nor is there, as Petitioners contend, a general affirmative duty on federal agencies requiring them to intervene against what is claimed to be unconstitutional state action.' After divorcing in 2010, Rutherford and ex-husband Daniel Giersch went through a nasty custody battle which ended with Giersch being awarded custody while the children were to visit Rutherford on vacations . Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 . Further, the court states 'the children have not been deported; they retain their United States citizenship and, once they reach the age of majority, they will be free to choose where to reside. 'There is, therefore, no non-frivolous constitutional question, only an attempt to seek federal judicial intervention in a state court custody dispute' The order affirmed the original order and said it would be improper for the federal court to intervene in Rutherford's custody battle. Because of this, there will be no intervention and the appeal will be dismissed. A California court ruled two years ago that the children should live in France with ex-husband Daniel Griesch, who she divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage. Rutherford has said that the court in Monaco, where Giersch lives, decided on a new custody order that lets her only see her children on holiday and during the summer. It has left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $2million in debt after spending all her earnings from Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children. In it's dismissal of her case, the court said it failed to\u00a0argue why the federal court should intervene in the custody dispute . Daily Mail Online revealed in August that Rutherford had filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of herself and her children. She sued the U.S. government, including Attorney General Holder and Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues. She wanted the US District Court in New York court to grant her \u2018temporary emergency authority\u2019 over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was \u2018unconstitutional\u2019. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said on November 24 that Rutherford's case was nothing more than her being dissatisfied with the result of the child-custody proceeding. The departments demanded on that her appeal be dismissed and said she's forcing the departments to become part of something they were never involved in. Rutherford argued her case in a New York court on March 18, but the appeal court shut down her plea and ordered the original order to remain in place.\nSummary: "}

The volume has been compiled by Enrico Quinto, 51, and Paolo Tinarelli, 49. The two men established the first flea market in Rome and were the first to introduce the concept of vintage in Italy. Enrico revealed that they wanted to honour the Italian designers who have helped to make the country a fashion powerhouse. He said: 'The pioneers that have really put Italy on the map of international fashion have been Emilio Pucci in the Fifties, Missoni and Krizia in the Sixties, Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace in the Seventies and Eighties, and Dolce & Gabbana, Prada and Gucci in the Nineties.' Fifties cover girl Ivy Nicholson wears Emilio Pucci in Capri, 1953. The book talks about how the start of many Italian fashion powerhouses started out with a real focus on craftsmanship . The book focuses on the humble beginnings of some of the world's biggest Italian brands and how they rose to cultural significance. It  looks at how designers such as Miuccia Prada, Giorgio Armani and Adele Casagrande, founder of Fendi, have created a legacy within their labels. Many Italian powerhouses started out with a focus on craftsmanship, using work methods and decorative traditions that were passed down through generations. Post-war economic development in the fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers such as Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with a patchwork of ideas and activities . The book also explores momentous periods which truly characterised Italian fashion. For example, post-war economic development in the Fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers like Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with patchworks of cartoon-like ideas and activities, which subtly influenced buyers.

Another poignant moment came in the mid-Fifties, where Italian fashion began to break away from what Parisian style dictated. Creative directors such as Emilio Frederico Schuberth began to create structurally innovative creations. Italian Glamour also looks at breakthrough moments for Italian fashion, such as one of the first runway showcases in Florence, which saw the artistic city overtake Paris as the global fashion capital. From that moment on, styles quickly progressed. By the mid-Forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones often seen in that period.

He adds: 'Italian glamour is not sophisticated or artificial; it keeps conscious of the female's body, and it works in the same way as the idea of 'Dolce Far Niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office said the three men are believed to be in their late teens or early 20s and were with a dog named Gunnar, who was either a golden retriever or a yellow lab. They were traveling in two vehicles with Minnesota license plates: a blue Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and a small passenger car. Left behind: Kelly and his wife Christie, pictured, have four sons and a daughter all under the age of nine . Authorities are also asking for help tracking down five people who were in the area at about 7.30pm as they have witnessed the argument that ultimately escalated. Now his small community in St Croix Falls, which has just 2,100 people, is mourning the loss of the family man who volunteered as a coach at the high school's football, baseball and wrestling teams. He would often go to work at 4am so he could get back in time to coach before dinner, fellow high school coach Dan Clark told the Star Tribune. His day job was at Andersen Windows in Bayport, where he worked in quality control. 'He worked 10 to 12 hours a day at Andersen Windows, and he would come home and volunteer four hours a night to our wrestling program for four or five months a year,' Clark toldFox9. 'He was one of the greatest human beings that I ever hoped to meet.' His wife, Christie, stayed at home to care for their children, who are all under nine. They have four boys, Kellen, Payton, Miles and August, and last year welcomed a baby girl, Molly. Devastated: His brother, Mike Kelly, said the man's children did not understand what had happened . Confrontation: Kelly and a friend were on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River, pictured, and told men on the Wisconsin side to stop making so much noise. Kelly was stabbed at Interstate Park . 'I don't think they fully understand the implications of what happened,' his brother, Mike Kelly, told KARE. 'His daughter will never even get to know him.' Friends and family added that they do not believe Kelly was to blame for the confrontation. 'He did good things, and did what was right all the time,' his brother added. 'And that's probably what cost him. Some knuckle heads swearing and being silly.' Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 715-485-8300.

{"article":"They will come up against each other in the year's first major on Thursday, but it wasn't that long ago that Rory McIlroy was looking up to Tiger Woods. The world No 1 - now 103 places above Woods in the world rankings - is the favourite to win the Masters next week and claim his first green jacket, thus completing a career Grand Slam. Woods, who has confirmed he is ready to play at Augusta after spell working on his game, is one of only five players to win the Masters, The Open, the US PGA Championship and the US Open - and it's that success which led to a young McIlroy aiming to emulate him. Scroll down for video . A young Rory McIlroy is portrayed by an actor in the film as it charts his progress in the sport .

McIlroy revealed recently that he sent Tiger a letter saying he was 'coming to get' him . Rory's rise from child prodigy to the world's best - along with his fascination with Woods' stellar career - has now been beautifully told in a new two-minute video created by their sponsors Nike. Entitled 'Ripple', the clip features a number of young actors portraying McIlroy as a kid and into his teenage years - from hitting plastic balls around his parents' living room, to practising relentlessly in his hometown of Holywood, Northern Ireland. A common theme runs through the video as McIlroy and his father keep a close eye on Tiger's progress on both the PGA Tour and at the major championships. Speaking about 'Ripple', McIlroy said: 'As a kid, I looked up to Tiger. When I first saw him on TV, I remember being completely enamored by the energy he brought to the sport. His will to win. His determination. His fight.' McIlroy and Woods will line up at Augusta for the Masters this week but in contrasting form .

{"article":"A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding (stock image above) A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding. Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of\u00a0Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding, which is due to take place in two days. She wrote: 'I do not want to get married, I took an oath at the time of admission that I will not get married before I turn 18.' She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times\u00a0reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known. Her father Lachhu, who lives in Gudibanda with Duli's mother, said child marriage was a common phenomenon in their society. He told the Hindustan Times\u00a0that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. But the country has the second highest number of child marriages, according to a UN report. Nearly 52 per cent of girls are married before reaching 18 years old, Indian records show. Between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides globally, analysts estimate. Aarati Benera, a women\u2019s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Above, women and girls sit waiting to be married in a mass wedding ceremony in India . Despite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. In 2013 there were around 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s.

Messi scored with the last kick and Luis Suarez scored with practically his first, putting Barcelona 1-0 up after just 56 seconds. Between the two strikes Claudio Bravo saved a Dani Parejo penalty as Valencia dominated the first half but they couldn't make their pressure tell. For Messi, still only 27, it was another milestone. 'I hope to score many more,' he wrote on his Facebook page. Lionel Messi (left), Luis Suarez (centre) and Neymar celebrate Suarez's goal in the first minute for Barcelona against Valencia . Suarez (left) lashed the ball in after neat play from Messi to continue his fine form for Barcelona . Valencia enjoyed a better first half, despite the scoreline and captain Dani Parejo missed a penalty in the ninth minute . Bravo celebrates his penalty save but Barcelona were fortunate to take a lead into half time . Messi tapped in Barcelona's second goal in stoppage time to seal the victory over Valencia . The Argentine has reached the 400 goal total in just 471 games with 309 goals in the league, 75 in the Champions League and 32 in the Copa del Rey. Goals in the World Club Cup and the Spanish and European Super Cup have also made up the stratospheric total. He also has 141 assists to his name in those 471 matches. Afterwards Luis Enrique said: \u2018Messi gave us what he always gives us. But it\u2019s not just about him it\u2019s about the whole forward line and the whole team.\u2019 Suarez was once again decisive after his two goals in midweek against PSG in the Champions League and he is now just six games from picking up a league winners medal in his first season. The early strike would have counted for nothing however if Valencia had made their first-half domination pay and had Bravo not stopped that eighth-minute penalty. As Messi raced from inside his own half to get the late late second, Enrique could be seen jumping up and down in the technical area long before the ball was in the back of the net. He knows what a major hurdle his side have now cleared. The victory sees Luis Enrique's side move five points away from Real Madrid, who take on Malaga later on Saturday . Messi skips past two Valencia challenges as Barcelona secured an important win against La Liga's fourth placed side . Messi attempts an acrobatic kick for Barcelona against Valencia in the La Liga encounter at the Nou Camp on Saturday . Barcelona were ahead inside the first minute with a move that swept from one end of the pitch to the other starting with Bravo releasing the ball quickly and finishing with a first time finish from Suarez past Diego Alves into far corner. Between the two Barca moved the ball quickly with Sergi Busquets releasing Messi and his pass poked home by the Uruguayan who has now scored 12 goals in his last 12 games. Far from being shell-shocked by the early set-back Valencia unleashed the big guns and Barcelona were under-fire for the rest of the first half. Paco Alcacer and Rodrigo both went close and were running an out-of-sorts Gerard Pique ragged. On eight minutes Valencia should have equalized. Rodrigo went down easily under a half challenge from Pique. It was a generous spot-kick and Bravo got down well to Parejo\u2019s kick to save it. With a full Camp Nou sensing that a win here would be a huge step towards the title for Barcelona, and Valencia in a scrap of their own to finish in the top four the game was being played at cup final pace. Parejo flattened Busquets who for once he didn't need to exaggerate the fall as he crashed to ground. And full-back Orban risked a first half sending off with foul after foul. He was shown a yellow and never appeared for the second period. Adding to the drama was the panic in Barcelona\u2019s defence. Pique was either failing to stay on his feet or giving the ball to Valencia forwards. The falling down was contagious with Adriano \u2013 another who didn\u2019t come out for the second half \u2013 also losing his footing despite the perfect playing conditions. Neymar (right) attempts a diving header for Barcelona as his side looked to increase their lead at the top of La Liga . Barcelona have a five-point lead over Madrid, who could cut the deficit to two points with victory over Malaga . Alcacer continued to threaten. It\u2019s not difficult to see why on-loan Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo, who Valencia are obliged to buy this summer, cannot get a game at the moment. It is also why many Spain supporters think Diego Costa should not be Vicente Del Bosque\u2019s first choice. Alcacer led the line and with Sofiane Feghouli and Rodrigo buzzing around him. Valencia gave Barcelona more problems than any visiting side at the Nou Camp this season. Alcacer came the closest in what remained of the first half making room for a shot from the edge of the area and hitting the base of Bravo\u2019s post but Barca remained a threat on the break. In their best move Messi and Suarez linked with Neymar who pulled the ball back to Xavi instead of finishing. The midfielder set-up Messi and his shot flashed wide. Games at the Nou Camp can be like bull fights that used to be held in Catalonia before they were banned. Everyone in the arena knows the bull loses, it\u2019s just a matter of when. But Valencia had worn the horns in the first half and Barcelona were relieved to get down the tunnel at half time still in one piece and still 1-0 up. The second half brought more calm to a Barcelona defence that now had Mascherano back alongside Pique after his first half spent in midfield. Valencia carried less threat and Barca went close with Neymar heading wide and Messi hitting the bar with a free-kick. He won a the kick with a brilliant run away from Parejo who up-ended him and his effort beat Diego Alves but not the frame of the goal. With 25 minutes left he moved to centre-forward as Suarez was taken off. There was no Neymar style sulk as he made his way off to a thunderous reception from the home fans. He goes into Tuesday\u2019s game against PSG looking for his 20th goal of what has been an excellent first season. Negredo replaced Alcacer and immediately Valencia had their best chance of the second half with Bravo palming away Rodrigo\u2019s shot. But there was to be no reward for all their fire and invention and when Messi raced clear to score the second with the last kick of the game it was all over in every sense.","highlights":"Luis Suarez scored Barcelona's opening goal against Valencia in the first minute of the game .\nClaudio Bravo kept out a tame penalty from Valencia captain Dani Parejo in the ninth .\nLionel Messi sealed the three points with one of the final kicks of the game .","id":"7d32cf1e7d8b0940e5d560f8454397f5a93dc1b4","prediction":["This article discusses the recent achievement of Lionel Messi, a renowned footballer, who scored his 400th goal for Barcelona during a match against Valencia.

Messi attempts an acrobatic kick for Barcelona against Valencia in the La Liga encounter at the Nou Camp on Saturday . Barcelona were ahead inside the first minute with a move that swept from one end of the pitch to the other starting with Bravo releasing the ball quickly and finishing with a first time finish from Suarez past Diego Alves into far corner. Between the two Barca moved the ball quickly with Sergi Busquets releasing Messi and his pass poked home by the Uruguayan who has now scored 12 goals in his last 12 games. Far from being shell-shocked by the early set-back Valencia unleashed the big guns and Barcelona were under-fire for the rest of the first half. Paco Alcacer and Rodrigo both went close and were running an out-of-sorts Gerard Pique ragged. On eight minutes Valencia should have equalized. Rodrigo went down easily under a half challenge from Pique. It was a generous spot-kick and Bravo got down well to Parejo\u2019s kick to save it. With a full Camp Nou sensing that a win here would be a huge step towards the title for Barcelona, and Valencia in a scrap of their own to finish in the top four the game was being played at cup final pace. Parejo flattened Busquets who for once he didn't need to exaggerate the fall as he crashed to ground. And full-back Orban risked a first half sending off with foul after foul. He was shown a yellow and never appeared for the second period. Adding to the drama was the panic in Barcelona\u2019s defence. Pique was either failing to stay on his feet or giving the ball to Valencia forwards. The falling down was contagious with Adriano \u2013 another who didn\u2019t come out for the second half \u2013 also losing his footing despite the perfect playing conditions. Neymar (right) attempts a diving header for Barcelona as his side looked to increase their lead at the top of La Liga . Barcelona have a five-point lead over Madrid, who could cut the deficit to two points with victory over Malaga . Alcacer continued to threaten. It\u2019s not difficult to see why on-loan Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo, who Valencia are obliged to buy this summer, cannot get a game at the moment. It is also why many Spain supporters think Diego Costa should not be Vicente Del Bosque\u2019s first choice. Alcacer led the line and with Sofiane Feghouli and Rodrigo buzzing around him. Valencia gave Barcelona more problems than any visiting side at the Nou Camp this season. Alcacer came the closest in what remained of the first half making room for a shot from the edge of the area and hitting the base of Bravo\u2019s post but Barca remained a threat on the break. In their best move Messi and Suarez linked with Neymar who pulled the ball back to Xavi instead of finishing. The midfielder set-up Messi and his shot flashed wide. Games at the Nou Camp can be like bull fights that used to be held in Catalonia before they were banned. Everyone in the arena knows the bull loses, it\u2019s just a matter of when. But Valencia had worn the horns in the first half and Barcelona were relieved to get down the tunnel at half time still in one piece and still 1-0 up. The second half brought more calm to a Barcelona defence that now had Mascherano back alongside Pique after his first half spent in midfield. Valencia carried less threat and Barca went close with Neymar heading wide and Messi hitting the bar with a free-kick. He won a the kick with a brilliant run away from Parejo who up-ended him and his effort beat Diego Alves but not the frame of the goal. With 25 minutes left he moved to centre-forward as Suarez was taken off. There was no Neymar style sulk as he made his way off to a thunderous reception from the home fans. He goes into Tuesday\u2019s game against PSG looking for his 20th goal of what has been an excellent first season. Negredo replaced Alcacer and immediately Valencia had their best chance of the second half with Bravo palming away Rodrigo\u2019s shot. But there was to be no reward for all their fire and invention and when Messi raced clear to score the second with the last kick of the game it was all over in every sense.\nSummary: "}
{"article":"Catania, Sicily (CNN)We are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight. Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now. Almost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come. It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a \"revolution\") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe. They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape. We could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided. The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed. And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official. That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden. \"If something serious isn't done,\" he warns, \"dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand.\" Increasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program. Others, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants. \"Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated,\" she recalled. \"Let's keep that in mind.\" Indeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home. That's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort.

{"article":"Greece warned it will go bankrupt next week after failing to stump up enough cash to pay millions of public sector workers and its international debts. Deputy finance minister Dimitras Mardas set alarm bells ringing yesterday when he declared the country had been 'running on empty' since February. With a debt repayment deadline looming on May 1, Greece faces the deeply damaging prospect of having to snub its own employees to make a \u20ac200m payment to\u00a0the International Monetary Fund. In a sign of the bleak climate engulfing the country, Greece's biggest tax office had its electricity cut off yesterday after the finance ministry failed to pay its power bills. At a summit in Brussels today, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to appeal to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for more aid to avoid going bust and a potential exit from the euro. Dire straights: Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives at an European Union leaders summit in Brussels as the country warned it was on the verge of bankruptcy with salary and debt repayment looming . Mardas caused consternation by saying Greece was about \u20ac350-400m short of funds needed this month to pay salaries and pensions that are due at the end of the month. But two hours later, he said the money had been found from social security funds and state corporations not listed on the stock exchange that would put their reserves in a Bank of Greece account. EU leaders fear the left-wing Syriza government will choose its workers, potentially pushing it out of the Eurozone and landing Europe with yet another crisis, it was reported by The Times. At a meeting today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to press Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to move faster to agree detailed economic reforms crucial to unlock international bailout funds before Athens runs out of cash. The conservative German leader was due to meet the leftist Greek premier a day before eurozone finance ministers meet in Riga to review progress -- or the lack of it -- in slow-moving negotiations between Athens and its creditors. EU officials said they expected Merkel to deliver a message that she wants to keep Greece in the single currency area and avoid a catastrophic default. EU leaders fear Mr Tsipras's left-wing Syriza government will choose to pay its workers than its IMF creditors, risking a default that potentially pushes it out of the Eurozone and lands Europe with yet another crisis . But to achieve that, Tsipras's government must make commitments in technical talks on detailed, costed measures to make public finances sustainable. 'At the highest level, the Germans want to keep Greece in the euro area and find a solution, but time is running short and there may have to be more drama before Tsipras can put his foot down and reach an agreement,' one senior official said. A Greek government official told Reuters in Athens that Tsipras would outline specific reforms to Merkel in a bid to appease creditors and is hoping she will intervene so that there is a breakthrough in the negotiations. The chancellor has so far insisted it is up to Athens to satisfy representatives of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, speaking in Berlin, said there were increasing doubts about the situation in Greece, warning that if financial instability returned, there would be no economic growth this year. He said he no longer expected an accord this month but negotiations could run beyond an April 30 deadline for a deal and he expected agreement sometime during May. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to press Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to move faster to agree detailed economic reforms crucial to unlock international bailout funds before Athens runs out of cash . UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino has warned that there will be no choice but to suspend Greece from international football unless the country's government rescinds proposed new laws. The Greek government has put forward a bill which could see sporting events cancelled due to incidents of crowd violence and teams prohibited from playing in European competition. UEFA and FIFA say that is direct government interference in football and have threatened to suspend Greece. Infantino said: 'Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference. 'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. 'I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football. Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team. If your clubs don't play in our competitions, their coefficient will also drop, meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.' UEFA and FIFA sent a final letter of warning on Wednesday but the Greek government is refusing to back down. Greece's deputy sports minister Stavros Kontonis told Greek television on Wednesday night: 'We are not going to change the philosophy of the sports bill. The supervision exercised in Greek football by FIFA and UEFA has failed.' Given its tight cash position, Greece had reasons to speed up the talks and its reform plans. 'Progress is not good,' he told ARD German television. Greece has yet to agree with its partners on a comprehensive list of reforms to secure \u20ac7.2billion remaining from its \u20ac240billion EU\/IMF bailout. Despite concerns raised yesterday, Eurozone and Greek officials indicated that Athens could probably scrape together public cash reserves to meet its payment obligations into June. But it faces a hump of bond redemptions to the ECB in July and August that it cannot meet without a fresh injection of funds. The ECB's chief economist, Peter Praet, said the central bank was prepared to keep authorising emergency lending to Greek banks for now because they were assessed to be solvent. 'It is true that it is a stressful situation,' Praet said at an event in Berlin. 'I'm not going to discuss how long this will go on. Verbal discipline is of the essence in crisis times.' Tsipras, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, is resisting cutting pensions, liberalising the labour market or raising value-added tax on Greek holiday islands. EU officials said Brussels was pressing Athens to move ahead with other measures, such as a radical shake-up of product and service markets to sweep away privileges and protections for vested interests, . It also called for greater fairness in taxation to shift the burden to the better-off and improve collection. They are also looking for progress on privatisations, which leftist ministers halted when they took office in late January. Tsipras's office said he would also have a private meeting with French President Francois Hollande on the summit sidelines. Greek daily Kathimerini reported that Athens is considering asking the euro zone's rescue fund to buy Greek government bonds held by the ECB to pay for debt redemptions due this summer. 'The aim of the government's plan is to have the European Stability Mechanism buy the bonds and reach a deal to repay them further out in time, as is the case with loans from the EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility),' the paper said without citing sources.

Deputy finance minister Dimitras Mardas set alarm bells ringing yesterday when he declared the country had been 'running on empty' since February. With a debt repayment deadline looming on May 1, Greece faces the deeply damaging prospect of having to snub its own employees to make a \u20ac200m payment to\u00a0the International Monetary Fund. In a sign of the bleak climate engulfing the country, Greece's biggest tax office had its electricity cut off yesterday after the finance ministry failed to pay its power bills. At a summit in Brussels today, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to appeal to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for more aid to avoid going bust and a potential exit from the euro. Dire straights: Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives at an European Union leaders summit in Brussels as the country warned it was on the verge of bankruptcy with salary and debt repayment looming . Mardas caused consternation by saying Greece was about \u20ac350-400m short of funds needed this month to pay salaries and pensions that are due at the end of the month. But two hours later, he said the money had been found from social security funds and state corporations not listed on the stock exchange that would put their reserves in a Bank of Greece account. EU leaders fear the left-wing Syriza government will choose its workers, potentially pushing it out of the Eurozone and landing Europe with yet another crisis, it was reported by The Times. At a meeting today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to press Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to move faster to agree detailed economic reforms crucial to unlock international bailout funds before Athens runs out of cash. The conservative German leader was due to meet the leftist Greek premier a day before eurozone finance ministers meet in Riga to review progress -- or the lack of it -- in slow-moving negotiations between Athens and its creditors. EU officials said they expected Merkel to deliver a message that she wants to keep Greece in the single currency area and avoid a catastrophic default. EU leaders fear Mr Tsipras's left-wing Syriza government will choose to pay its workers than its IMF creditors, risking a default that potentially pushes it out of the Eurozone and lands Europe with yet another crisis . But to achieve that, Tsipras's government must make commitments in technical talks on detailed, costed measures to make public finances sustainable. 'At the highest level, the Germans want to keep Greece in the euro area and find a solution, but time is running short and there may have to be more drama before Tsipras can put his foot down and reach an agreement,' one senior official said. A Greek government official told Reuters in Athens that Tsipras would outline specific reforms to Merkel in a bid to appease creditors and is hoping she will intervene so that there is a breakthrough in the negotiations. The chancellor has so far insisted it is up to Athens to satisfy representatives of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, speaking in Berlin, said there were increasing doubts about the situation in Greece, warning that if financial instability returned, there would be no economic growth this year. He said he no longer expected an accord this month but negotiations could run beyond an April 30 deadline for a deal and he expected agreement sometime during May. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to press Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to move faster to agree detailed economic reforms crucial to unlock international bailout funds before Athens runs out of cash . UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino has warned that there will be no choice but to suspend Greece from international football unless the country's government rescinds proposed new laws. The Greek government has put forward a bill which could see sporting events cancelled due to incidents of crowd violence and teams prohibited from playing in European competition. UEFA and FIFA say that is direct government interference in football and have threatened to suspend Greece. Infantino said: 'Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference. 'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. 'I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football. Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team. If your clubs don't play in our competitions, their coefficient will also drop, meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.' UEFA and FIFA sent a final letter of warning on Wednesday but the Greek government is refusing to back down. Greece's deputy sports minister Stavros Kontonis told Greek television on Wednesday night: 'We are not going to change the philosophy of the sports bill. The supervision exercised in Greek football by FIFA and UEFA has failed.' Given its tight cash position, Greece had reasons to speed up the talks and its reform plans. 'Progress is not good,' he told ARD German television. Greece has yet to agree with its partners on a comprehensive list of reforms to secure \u20ac7.2billion remaining from its \u20ac240billion EU\/IMF bailout. Despite concerns raised yesterday, Eurozone and Greek officials indicated that Athens could probably scrape together public cash reserves to meet its payment obligations into June. But it faces a hump of bond redemptions to the ECB in July and August that it cannot meet without a fresh injection of funds. The ECB's chief economist, Peter Praet, said the central bank was prepared to keep authorising emergency lending to Greek banks for now because they were assessed to be solvent. 'It is true that it is a stressful situation,' Praet said at an event in Berlin. 'I'm not going to discuss how long this will go on. Verbal discipline is of the essence in crisis times.' Tsipras, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, is resisting cutting pensions, liberalising the labour market or raising value-added tax on Greek holiday islands. EU officials said Brussels was pressing Athens to move ahead with other measures, such as a radical shake-up of product and service markets to sweep away privileges and protections for vested interests, . It also called for greater fairness in taxation to shift the burden to the better-off and improve collection. They are also looking for progress on privatisations, which leftist ministers halted when they took office in late January. Tsipras's office said he would also have a private meeting with French President Francois Hollande on the summit sidelines. Greek daily Kathimerini reported that Athens is considering asking the euro zone's rescue fund to buy Greek government bonds held by the ECB to pay for debt redemptions due this summer. 'The aim of the government's plan is to have the European Stability Mechanism buy the bonds and reach a deal to repay them further out in time, as is the case with loans from the EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility),' the paper said without citing sources. That would amount to a third Greek bailout requiring euro zone governments' agreement and parliamentary approval in some countries, such as Germany and Finland, which could only be achieved if there were a deal on a comprehensive reform package.\nSummary: "}

{"article":"It is billed as the most important meal of the day and many people grade a restaurant on the quality of their bacon and eggs on offer. But after fierce competition and testing, experts have ruled the the best breakfast is available from your local Morrisons. The supermarket beat major hotel, restaurant and pub chains to achieve the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu . It was picked out by judges of the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS) for its value for money, food quality and customer satisfaction. Richard Jones, Morrisons Head Chef, said: 'The Great British breakfast is a national institution, so to be voted the nation's best is an honour. 'The secret of our success is offering shoppers a good selection of fresh breakfast items to please all tastes - granola and porridge have become very popular in recent times, and of course there's nothing like the breakfast of champions, the Full English.' The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for \u00a34.50. Morrisons was named best in the breakfast category, beating Wetherspoons and Bella Italia which were shortlisted for the awards. Last year the award went to Intercontinental Hotels which charges \u00a328 for its cooked breakfast at its 5-star London Park Lane hotel. And the year before Macdonald Hotels won the accolade. A full English at its 4-star Macdonald Manchester Hotel and Spa costs \u00a319.50 . Mystery shoppers tried breakfasts at restaurants, pubs and hotels nationwide to name Morrisons the winner . The MIDAS awards were launched to recognise the efforts of food development managers in major restaurant and food service chains, and previous winners include\u00a0the Marriott and InterContinental hotel groups. As part of the judging process organisers send a team of 'mystery shoppers' to try the breakfast menu at all competing venues - from croissants and bacon rolls to the Full English. They then score each menu in terms of value for money, food quality and customer expectation levels. Morrisons' 400 in-store cafes, which serve breakfast until 4pm. Nationwide they sell 100,000 Big Breakfasts a week, and also stock vegetarian options. Morrison's nationwide sell around 10,000 of their signature 'Big Breakfast' a week. This has: . 3 x rashers of British Market St. Bacon . 1 x British Market St. Sausage . 1 x Egg (choice of Fried, Scrambled or Poached) 2 x Hash Browns . Heinz Baked Beanz . Mushrooms . Fried Tomato . Fried Bread . Served with red or brown sauce . Simon Peat, of award organisers Inside Foodservice, said: 'Our judges were dispatched to three Morrisons across the country, to try the full range of items on the menu, and they scored top marks each time. Morrisons is the best place for breakfast. 'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.' British breakfast staples have enjoyed a boost in popularity recently - with sales of British back bacon and eggs increasing. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over \u00a333million worth of the meat to nearly 70 countries, with another \u00a31.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. Eggs were exported to 57 countries.","highlights":"Morrisons was awarded the title of serving the best breakfast in Britain .\nSupermarket chain beat hotels, pubs and restaurants to win the title .\nIt achieved the accolade in the Menu Innovation and Development Awards .\nJudges sent mystery shoppers to try breakfasts nationwide to find winner .","id":"1f0090752904620fde807f19ff8b497e17f19d4d","prediction":["This article discusses how Morrisons, a supermarket chain, has been awarded the title of Britain's Best Breakfast.

But after fierce competition and testing, experts have ruled the the best breakfast is available from your local Morrisons. The supermarket beat major hotel, restaurant and pub chains to achieve the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu . It was picked out by judges of the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS) for its value for money, food quality and customer satisfaction. Richard Jones, Morrisons Head Chef, said: 'The Great British breakfast is a national institution, so to be voted the nation's best is an honour. 'The secret of our success is offering shoppers a good selection of fresh breakfast items to please all tastes - granola and porridge have become very popular in recent times, and of course there's nothing like the breakfast of champions, the Full English.' The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for \u00a34.50. Morrisons was named best in the breakfast category, beating Wetherspoons and Bella Italia which were shortlisted for the awards. Last year the award went to Intercontinental Hotels which charges \u00a328 for its cooked breakfast at its 5-star London Park Lane hotel. And the year before Macdonald Hotels won the accolade. A full English at its 4-star Macdonald Manchester Hotel and Spa costs \u00a319.50 . Mystery shoppers tried breakfasts at restaurants, pubs and hotels nationwide to name Morrisons the winner . The MIDAS awards were launched to recognise the efforts of food development managers in major restaurant and food service chains, and previous winners include\u00a0the Marriott and InterContinental hotel groups. As part of the judging process organisers send a team of 'mystery shoppers' to try the breakfast menu at all competing venues - from croissants and bacon rolls to the Full English. They then score each menu in terms of value for money, food quality and customer expectation levels. Morrisons' 400 in-store cafes, which serve breakfast until 4pm. Nationwide they sell 100,000 Big Breakfasts a week, and also stock vegetarian options. Morrison's nationwide sell around 10,000 of their signature 'Big Breakfast' a week. This has: . 3 x rashers of British Market St. Bacon . 1 x British Market St. Sausage . 1 x Egg (choice of Fried, Scrambled or Poached) 2 x Hash Browns . Heinz Baked Beanz . Mushrooms . Fried Tomato . Fried Bread . Served with red or brown sauce . Simon Peat, of award organisers Inside Foodservice, said: 'Our judges were dispatched to three Morrisons across the country, to try the full range of items on the menu, and they scored top marks each time. Morrisons is the best place for breakfast. 'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.' British breakfast staples have enjoyed a boost in popularity recently - with sales of British back bacon and eggs increasing. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over \u00a333million worth of the meat to nearly 70 countries, with another \u00a31.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. Eggs were exported to 57 countries.\nSummary: "}
{"article":"This is the chilling message a mother wrote on Facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21-year-old son in the Pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible. 'I'm so happy,' Nyia Parler, 41, commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on Tuesday. Just 24 hours earlier, police say she wheeled her care-dependent son into a park near their home in south west Philadelphia and left him there, before going to stay with her partner in Maryland. Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class on Tuesday, commented on Parler's picture, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' On Sunday police said that Parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself. Parler was admitted to a Maryland facility on Sunday for an 'undisclosed condition' and faces charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police in Pennsylvania. 'When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition,' Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police said in a statement. Chilling: This is the message Nyia Parler wrote on Facebook hours after she allegedly left her quadriplegic son alone in woodland with just a blanket and a bible. Relatives contacted by the boy's school frantically replied . Charged: Parler (right) was detained in Maryland on Saturday night, charged with assault and neglect. Police say she left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left) in Montgomery County, Maryland . Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . Parler left her son \u2014 who also has cerebral palsy \u2014 lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair while she left town on a romantic getaway with her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, police said. He was found on Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he had been there for five days and the last time he and his mother were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then boarded a bus to bisit Ferguson in Maryland, said Lt. John Walker of the Southwest Detectives Division. Walker said the victim was found around the corner from their home, and he described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place: 'She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away.' During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was 'completely defenseless' in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said. 'It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing,' he said. Reports claim relatives have been trying to obtain guardianship of the boy from Parler (pictured) for years . Contacted in Maryland after the young man's school became concerned about her absence, the victim's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her, Walker said. 'Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful,' he said. Her boyfriend, however, assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and 'was in shock when he learned what happened,' Walker said. A 16-year-old son also residing with the family is now in the care of other family relatives, Walker added. Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries, but he appeared to be improving. 'He seemed to be a little happier yesterday,' Walker said. 'You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable. The 21-year-old, who is non-verbal and suffers from cerebral palsy, is now in Philadelphia Children's Hospital with his aunts, where he is being treated for dehydration and cuts to his back and eyes. Officials told\u00a0NBC Philadelphia\u00a0her son would have died if he hadn't been spotted by people walking along a nearby street. 'This kid is obviously a fighter. It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that,' Lt. Walker of Philadelphia Police told\u00a0ABC. Abandoned: A passerby noticed the 21-year-old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . The son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a cut to his back and eye injuries. According to Philly.com\u00a0two of his aunts, who are with him in hospital, have been trying to obtain guardianship for years.

Another, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school. Nothing looked wrong, I didn't suspect anything.' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers. 'A lot of things could have happened out there,' he said. 'Obviously he's in the middle of a wooded area. You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself. He does not function at all.' Walker added : 'What we've learned so far is that the 21-year-old child lives with his mother, completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition.

{"article":"Manchester City have not won a Premier League game having been behind at half-time in almost 20 years. The shocking stat is revealed as City's title hopes lay in tatters following Monday night's 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace which Manuel Pellegrini's side trailed at the interval. The last time City managed to win having been in a losing position at half-time was on April 17, 1995 when they beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 having been 2-1 down at the break. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart trudge off the field after losing to Crystal Palace . Man City have not managed to win a Premier League fixture having trailed at half-time in almost 20 years . Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini looks to the floor at Selhurst Park as his side's title dreams lay in tatters . While City have spent five seasons out of the top-flight since the 1994-95 campaign - which Rovers went on to win - the stat still makes for incredible reading as the blue side of Manchester look to retain their Premier League crown and claim their third title in four seasons. City's goalscorers that day were defender Keith Curle, now manager of League 2 strugglers Carlisle, from the penalty spot,  former Brentford boss Uwe Rosler and Paul Walsh. City went on to finish the Premier League season in 17th, two places above the drop zone. Blackburn: Flowers, Kenna, Berg, Pearce, Hendry, Le Saux, Sherwood, Atkins (Batty, 78), Ripley, Sutton, Shearer. Scorers: Shearer, 7, Hendry, 39. Booked: Sutton, Atkins. Manchester City: Coton, Edghill, Foster, Curle, Kernaghan, Summerbee, Flitcroft, Simpson, Rosler, Walsh (Beagrie, 78), Quinn. Scorers: Curle (pen), 32, Rosler, 57, Walsh 71.

Alan Shearer celebrates for the eventual Premier League winners after scoring the opener on seven minutes . While City have not won having trailed at the interval in almost two decades, all of City's top six rivals have managed to overturn half-time deficits in the last five years. Spurs came from behind to beat Hull in November 2014, Manchester United and Chelsea claimed victory after trailing at half-time last season. Liverpool beat Aston Villa after losing 1-0 at the interval against Aston Villa in March 2013 while Arsenal came from 2-1 down to beat Chelsea 5-3 in October 2011. To make matters worse, it seems Manuel Pellegrini's men are in need of some new blood. City had the second oldest starting XI in the Premier League this weekend with an average age of 29 years and 345 days; only West Brom fielded an older side, during their 4-1 home defeat to QPR. Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and goalkeeper Joe Hart were the only starters against Palace aged 28 or under. Arsenal \u2013 29\/10\/11 \u2013 2-1 down at Chelsea at HT, won 5-3 .

The shocking stat is revealed as City's title hopes lay in tatters following Monday night's 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace which Manuel Pellegrini's side trailed at the interval. The last time City managed to win having been in a losing position at half-time was on April 17, 1995 when they beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 having been 2-1 down at the break. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart trudge off the field after losing to Crystal Palace . Man City have not managed to win a Premier League fixture having trailed at half-time in almost 20 years . Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini looks to the floor at Selhurst Park as his side's title dreams lay in tatters . While City have spent five seasons out of the top-flight since the 1994-95 campaign - which Rovers went on to win - the stat still makes for incredible reading as the blue side of Manchester look to retain their Premier League crown and claim their third title in four seasons. City's goalscorers that day were defender Keith Curle, now manager of League 2 strugglers Carlisle, from the penalty spot,  former Brentford boss Uwe Rosler and Paul Walsh. City went on to finish the Premier League season in 17th, two places above the drop zone. Blackburn: Flowers, Kenna, Berg, Pearce, Hendry, Le Saux, Sherwood, Atkins (Batty, 78), Ripley, Sutton, Shearer. Scorers: Shearer, 7, Hendry, 39. Booked: Sutton, Atkins. Manchester City: Coton, Edghill, Foster, Curle, Kernaghan, Summerbee, Flitcroft, Simpson, Rosler, Walsh (Beagrie, 78), Quinn. Scorers: Curle (pen), 32, Rosler, 57, Walsh 71. Booked: Kernaghan, Simpson. Paul Walsh scores  in April 1995 - the last time Man City won having trailed at half-time in the Premier League . Uwe Rosler (left) celebrates equalising against Blackburn as Man City staged a comeback at Ewood Park . Alan Shearer celebrates for the eventual Premier League winners after scoring the opener on seven minutes . While City have not won having trailed at the interval in almost two decades, all of City's top six rivals have managed to overturn half-time deficits in the last five years. Spurs came from behind to beat Hull in November 2014, Manchester United and Chelsea claimed victory after trailing at half-time last season. Liverpool beat Aston Villa after losing 1-0 at the interval against Aston Villa in March 2013 while Arsenal came from 2-1 down to beat Chelsea 5-3 in October 2011. To make matters worse, it seems Manuel Pellegrini's men are in need of some new blood. City had the second oldest starting XI in the Premier League this weekend with an average age of 29 years and 345 days; only West Brom fielded an older side, during their 4-1 home defeat to QPR. Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and goalkeeper Joe Hart were the only starters against Palace aged 28 or under. Arsenal \u2013 29\/10\/11 \u2013 2-1 down at Chelsea at HT, won 5-3 . Chelsea \u2013 11\/5\/14 \u2013 1-0 down at Cardiff at HT, won 2-1 . Liverpool \u2013 31\/3\/13 \u2013 1-0 down at Aston Villa at HT, won 2-1 . Manchester United\u00a0\u2013 5\/10\/13 \u2013 1-0 down at Sunderland at HT, won 2-1 . Tottenham\u00a0 \u2013 23\/11\/14 \u2013 1-0 down at Hull at HT, won 2-1 .

{"article":"Kolo Toure has warned Raheem Sterling that leaving Liverpool could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club, similar to the way that Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair did at Manchester City. Sterling stunned Liverpool earlier this week, giving an interview confirming that he has turned down a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is 'quite flattered' by interest from Arsenal. Chelsea and Manchester City are also keen on English football's hottest property. But Toure, who used to play for  City with Rodwell and Sinclair, has warned his Anfield team-mate a move to one of European football's heavyweights may not be everything he has dreamed of. Raheem Sterling has been warned about the dangers of leaving Liverpool by his team-mate Kolo Toure . Toure compared Sterling's situation with that of Jack Rodwell (left) and Scott Sinclair joining Manchester City . Toure (centre) says Liverpool is the best place for Sterling to stay and continue his development as a player . After starring in Everton's midfield and making his England debut, Jack Rodwell was being linked with every big club around. Sir Alex Ferguson was known to be an admirer but Rodwell was snapped up by Manchester City for \u00a312million. Repeated injury problems and the presence of Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri and Javi Garcia saw his appearances limited, while Fernandinho arrived for \u00a330m the next summer. After just seven league starts in two years, Rodwell moved on to relegation-threatened Sunderland for \u00a310m. It was a similar story for Scott Sinclair. After powering Swansea City's promotion to the Premier League and scoring eight times in the top flight, Chelsea youth product Sinclair moved to City for \u00a38m. But he too struggled with the competition in City's squad and moved to West Bromwich Albion on loan last season. He found it hard to break into the team there and returned to City before heading out on loan again to Aston Villa in January where he has found some form. Rodwell joined City in a \u00a312million deal in 2012, while Sinclair made the same move from Swansea City for an \u00a38m fee later that summer. The English pair made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances between them across two seasons at the Etihad Stadium. Rodwell joined relegation-threatened Sunderland last summer to end his City nightmare while Sinclair is trying to rebuild his career at Aston Villa. Toure says Sterling could be making a similar mistake by leaving Anfield. 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play,' Toure said. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he wouldn't be sure to start games. Make a mistake or don't score for two games and he will be on the bench. There is no messing at clubs like that.' Brendan Rodgers used his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Arsenal to reiterate that Sterling was not for sale, and Toure sees Liverpool as the perfect place for the 20-year-old to continue his development. 'I'm not surprised there's speculation because everybody would want to have a player like him,' he told the Liverpool ECHO. 'But he needs to stay here. Liverpool is a great place for him. Sterling stunned Liverpool this week, giving an interview confirming that he had turned down a new deal . The likes of Chelsea, City and Arsenal would have big competition in their squads for a place . 'This is definitely the best place for him to continue his development. At Liverpool, he's beginning to be one of the most important players. He's playing every week. 'If he went to another club there would be big challenges he would face. He wouldn't be the most important player.' Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Chelsea had joined the race to sign England star Sterling, with the Premier League leaders wanting to be kept informed of any developments in his contract situation. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also monitoring the developments in his stand-off at Anfield. Rodwell made just seven Premier League starts for City during his two-year spell before leaving the club . The former Everton man now plays for relegation-threatened Sunderland after a tough time at City . Sinclair's spell was even more difficult, he made just two league starts for City before moving out on loan . Sinclair is on loan at Aston Villa as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a young England talent . Doubts over Arsenal\u2019s ability to fund a move have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him with the likes of Chelsea and City. Liverpool boss Rodgers said on Thursday:\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he\u2019s not going anywhere in the summer. 'I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn\u2019t come into it. If the club doesn\u2019t want to sell, it won\u2019t sell, it\u2019s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. \u2018Whatever player - Raheem or anybody - it would always be on the terms of the club. \u2018He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it\u2019s not something we\u2019re overly concerned about. I\u2019m confident that at the end of the season we\u2019ll find the solution.\u2019 Brendan Rodgers has said Sterling is going nowhere this summer despite the speculation over his future .

Liverpool boss Rodgers said on Thursday:\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he\u2019s not going anywhere in the summer. 'I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn\u2019t come into it. If the club doesn\u2019t want to sell, it won\u2019t sell, it\u2019s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. \u2018Whatever player - Raheem or anybody - it would always be on the terms of the club. \u2018He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it\u2019s not something we\u2019re overly concerned about. I\u2019m confident that at the end of the season we\u2019ll find the solution.\u2019 Brendan Rodgers has said Sterling is going nowhere this summer despite the speculation over his future . Sinclair spent more time on the bench than the pitch at City, and Toure thinks it could be similar for Sterling .\nSummary: "}
{"article":"A 32-year-old English teacher who admitted having sex with a 16-year-old student posted a celebratory selfie on Instagram just hours after discovering she had avoided a prison sentence. Shelley Dufresnein from St Charles Parish, Louisiana, took a plea deal on Thursday that gets her out of serving any time behind or having to register as a sex offender. When she returned home from court she uploaded an image of her grinning to the social media site alongside the message: 'My mood today,' followed by three smiley faces. Followers started congratulating her on the outcome below the picture, prompting her to respond: 'I'm so relieved.' However she is still facing charges over a threesome she had with the same student at Destrehan High School and another teacher. 'My mood today': Shelley Dufresnein from St Charles Parish, Louisiana, posted this selfie on Instagram after discovering she had avoided jail - despite admitting she had sex with a 16-year-old student . Reaction: Followers started congratulating her on the outcome below the picture, prompting her to respond: 'I'm so relieved'. However she still faces charges she had a threesome with the student and another teacher . 'Free' woman: The 32-year-old, confessed in court Thursday to having sex with a 16-year-old English student in exchange for a plea deal that gets her out of prison time. The married mother-of-three pictured above leaving the St Charles Parish Courthouse on Thursday . Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . She was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays. Both Dufresne and Respess were suspended from their jobs without pay following their arrests last fall.","highlights":"Shelley Dufresnein of St Charles Parish, Louisiana, took a plea deal .\nMother-of-three avoided prison and won't have to register as a sex offender .\nTook an image of her smiling after the hearing and wrote: 'My mood today'\nAlso said she was 'relieved' when followers began congratulating her .\nIs still facing charges over an alleged threesome she had with the same student and fellow teacher\u00a0Rachel Respess, 24 .","id":"bd47660646956a2257203d201077b7a300f87f04","prediction":["This article discusses the case of Shelley Dufresnein, a 32-year-old English teacher from St Charles Parish, Louisiana, who admitted to having sexual relations with a 16-year-old student.

{"article":"Arrest: Timothy Rogalski allegedly repeatedly called Sandy Hook Elementary School on Tuesday . A man has been arrested for repeatedly calling Sandy Hook Elementary School and accusing staff members of staging the 2012 school massacre. Timothy Rogalski, from\u00a0Wallingford, Connecticut, called the school on Tuesday morning and left four messages on its office answerphone. The fifth time he called, he spoke to an administrative assistant. In the calls, the 30-year-old accused staff of being behind the December 14, 2012 shooting that left 20 children and six female educators dead, according to police in Monroe. He also said the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2014 were fake, police said. Authorities traced the calls back to the home Rogalski shares with his father, about 40 miles from where the 2012 attack unfolded, and he was arrested. 'I don't think I said anything that horrible,' Rogalski said at a court appearance on Wednesday, NBC Connecticut reported. He has been charged with harassment and disorderly conduct and is being held on $2,500 bond. He was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and not to contact anyone at the school. He will next appear in court on April 22. Arrest: The calls were traced to his home in Wallingford, pictured, which is about 40 miles from where the shooting unfolded in Newtown in 2012.

Rogalski allegedly made the calls to Sandy Hook Elementary, which is operating temporarily in Monroe as a new school is built to replace the old one, and two other nearby schools. The original site of the school was demolished a year after the shootings. The gunman's home, where he shot dead his mother before going on the killing spree at the school, was also torn down in earlier this year. Rogalski's arrest does not mark the first time threatening calls have been made about the killings. In the days following the 2012 school shooting, Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman, 31, looked up Newtown residents' phone numbers from his home in Venezuela and made more than 90 calls.

{"article":"Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead. A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed \"powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children.\" Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. \"It was horror,\" said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. \"People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone.\" Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: \"If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?!

A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed \"powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children.\" Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. \"It was horror,\" said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. \"People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone.\" Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors.

{"article":"Known locally as Millionaires\u2019 Row, the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac of 11 white Art Deco houses with private beaches at the end of Hove promenade is a real-life version of the TV comedy Stella Street. The sitcom featured impressionists playing celebrities such as Michael Caine and Keith Richards living as neighbours. But put the rubbish out here in Hove and you could be saying good morning to Oscar and Grammy award-winning singer Adele, Little Britain comedian and novelist David Walliams, DJ Norman Cook and his Strictly Come Dancing wife Zoe Ball, and former EastEnders and Heartbeat star Nick Berry. Scroll down for video . One of the white Art Deco houses on the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac has gone on sale for \u00a34million . In previous years you might have been greeted by Paul McCartney, his then wife Heather Mills, or even by partying guests such as Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. The homes were built between 1909 and 1910 by developer Michael Paget Baxter when overcrowding on British beaches in their heyday meant that a home with a private beach was the last word in luxury. And that still seems to be true. With celebrities occupying six of the properties \u2013 Cook and his wife have three, two for them and one for relatives \u2013 that leaves just five other houses. And in a rare event, one of those has just come on the market, for a guide price of \u00a34 million. Approached from the back, the cul-de-sac does not look anything special, tucked away behind the warehouses of the working port of Shoreham. But sitting in the lounge of Malcolm VandenBurg\u2019s splendid home on a sunny day, with the sea seemingly lapping at the floor-to-ceiling windows, you could be in Miami or Malibu. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors. Decking stretches on to the beach, and there is a hot tub. Stunning: The view of the sea from the property's modern living room. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors . Meet the locals: Singer Adele has a house in the exclusive cul-de-sac alongside comedian David Walliams . \u2018Bringing the sea into the house was the aim,\u2019 says Malcolm, a retired Harley Street doctor. \u2018Bizarrely, the former owners didn\u2019t make use of the sea views. So I opened up the back and put the terrace in and the balcony upstairs. \u2018Now, when you walk in the front door you can see the sea from everywhere. It took a year but it was well worth it. It still takes my breath away every time I come home. \u2018And sitting outside on the terrace with a fish barbecue with the sound system on full is just perfect. I\u2019ve had a lot of impromptu parties.\u2019 Malcolm, in his 60s and the father of four grown-up children, bought the four-bedroom house in 2010 after moving from London, where he had seen Adele perform at the Roundhouse in what he describes as his favourite gig of all time. So when the singer moved in to the cul-de-sac, he was \u2018starstruck\u2019. \u2018She has this lovely little dog and, in the summer, when all the doors are open, the dog wanders into my house and Adele comes round to find it. She\u2019s completely normal and everyone here is very pleasant and we all get on well,\u2019 says Malcolm. Price \u00a34 million . Location Hove, East Sussex . Bedrooms 4 . Unique features Beach for a back garden; cinema room; huge dressing room; high-tech controls for hi-fi, curtains, lighting; celebrities on every side . He also welcomed Walliams and his wife, model Lara Stone, by taking round a bunch of flowers. Unhappily they have now split up. Cook popped round one day when he heard that Malcolm was selling his vinyl record collection. \u2018I thought he might buy the lot, but he didn\u2019t want any of them,\u2019 he laughs. The ground floor of Malcolm\u2019s house has oak flooring throughout and there is a large entrance hall with a floating staircase, a media\/cinema room, kitchen, snug and a 45ft lounge. Upstairs, the master suite and bathroom overlook the sea and a huge dressing room is the size of some of the designer clothes shops in the nearby North Laine of Brighton. Malcolm\u2019s home has the latest high-tech automated systems, including a Lutron lighting control system, video door entry, digital music and video systems, integrated speakers, motorised curtains \u2013 in fact, everything a celebrity would be looking for. So who does he think will buy the house? Has Cook already been round with an offer to add to his portfolio? \u2018No he hasn\u2019t,\u2019 says Malcolm. \u2018I think he\u2019s happy with what he has at the moment. But whoever does buy will never get tired of the wonderful, ever-changing views.

{"article":"(CNN)Sophisticated, glamorous and spacious -- when the super-rich go house-hunting they are searching for something special. Real estate in London's swankier suburbs can catch a buyers' eye. Mayfair, Kensington and Chelsea have long been the stomping ground of the elite -- and are now welcoming a new wave of African investors. \"The Africans who are coming into London now are Africans who themselves have worked for their money,\" explains Bimpe Nkontchou, a British-Nigerian wealth manager based in London. \"They have grown in industry and are actually part of the exciting story of the African renaissance,\" she continues. \"It's bringing to London the best of the continent.\" These investors are having a considerable impact on London's property market and they mainly come from just six countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal. Of these, Nigerians are splashing out the most cash when it comes to bricks and mortar in the British capital -- typically spending between $22 and $37 million on securing a property, according to luxury property agents Beauchamp Estates. Their research shows that over the past three years Africans have spent over $900 million on luxury residential property in London. \"The new international African is very well-traveled,\" explains Nkontchou. \"Educated in the U.S., UK and different parts of Europe their taste is definitely more modern and clean.\" 'Safe-Haven' Owning a home in post codes like W1 or W8 -- around the corner from Kensington Palace -- means more than having a place to lay your head. These buildings are investments which are expected to gain even bigger value in the coming years. High-end auction house Sotheby's says that foreign investors see London as a \"safe haven\"  for prime property investments, and ranks the city as the second most important hub for ultra high-net-worth homes. The only spot more important on the planet is New York City. For evidence that London still attracts high-end buyers, look no further than the sale of a penthouse in Mayfair which fetched $40 million earlier this year. Educated thinking . As well as an intelligent investment, many of the African buyers see these houses as a way of maintaining long standing cultural ties with London -- and it's here they want to send their children to school. Harrow, Eton, Cheltenham Ladies College are all among the list of respected institutions that teach the offspring of wealthy Africans. The Nigerian Embassy in London calculates that Nigerian nationals now spend over $446 million per year on fees, tutoring and accommodation at British schools and university. \"West African clients are very much driven by the need to educate their children,\" says Nkontchou. \"Education usually means putting the children on an international stage, and that's one reason why this is feeding into the demand for property in London.\" Indeed, education industry experts ICEF Monitor say there were over 17,500 Nigerians studying in British universities in 2012  -- about 1,000 more than the 2009\/10 academic session. And experts are expecting this trend to continue. \"Virtually all the transactions are for end use, not rental investment, which indicates that the African buyer market in London has significant room for growth,\" says Gary Hersham, director at Beauchamp Estates. \"African buyers or luxury tenants in London are currently where the Russians and Ukrainians were five years ago.

Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for\u00a0Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game,\u00a0USA Today\u00a0reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year.

'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.'

{"article":"With house prices soaring, it's not easy finding somewhere to live. And this community has thrown in the towel. Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust.

And this community has thrown in the towel. Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust. 'These RVs are their homes so it's a very personal thing,' she explained.\nSummary: "}

{"article":"The collapse in Roberto Mancini's relationship with Manchester City was rooted in his dismay at the quality of English players signed by the club. When names like Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell and to a lesser extent Adam Johnson were signed, he could barely disguise his contempt, feeling none of them would help him take on Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League. 'Ask Marwood,' he would spit out when asked about the club's transfer policy, referring to the club's then-football administrator Brian Marwood who was responsible at the time for buying players. Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been linked with a move to Manchester City . Mancini was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on, Marwood has a new role at the academy with a Spaniard, Txiki Begiristain, in his old job with the title director of football. And yet the dilemma remains the same: How do City buy enough top English players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking FPP (financial fair play) regulations again? It won't be easy and could explain why City \u2013 who have slumped to fourth in the league \u2013 are being linked with less glamorous names like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell. Good players certainly, but good enough? Probably not. It's a sobering thought that Rodwell made only seven Premier League starts in two seasons for City after a \u00a312million move from Everton. Sinclair started just twice after signing from Swansea and is currently on loan at Aston Villa. Plenty of things at City have been carefully planned and executed well since the club's owners from Abu Dhabi took over in 2008. (From left) Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, assistant manager Brian Kidd, manager Manuel Pellegrini and former football administrator Brian Marwood . The Etihad Campus is a glittering monument to football development and helping the community, while two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup is an excellent trophy haul considering where the club have come from. But one weakness has been in their approach to having enough homegrown players, lagging behind most of their rivals. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers and Manchester United bought Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw as teenagers. Most spectacularly, Liverpool bought players like Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling and invested in making them better. Spurs have brought through Harry Kane and Ryan Mason from their academy. Only Chelsea face similar issues to City. Homegrown rules are complicated and differ slightly between competitions. Scott Sinclair (left) and Jack\u00a0Rodwell are two English players who were bought by Manchester City . In the Premier League, you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25. Homegrown players can be born overseas as long as they have been at a club's academy three years before the age of 21. If clubs can't find eight, they have to reduce their squad accordingly, as Chelsea have had to this season. Under 21 players can be named in the squad in addition to the 25. City's six Premier League homegrown players are: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner and there lies a major problem for next season. Lampard is definitely off and Milner is out of contract too. Clichy has endured a poor season and City will want a new left-back while Boyata, a Belgian who has been at City since he was 16, is not good enough to win a regular first-team place. The feeling is he was only offered his latest contract because he filled one of the homegrown slots. Ditto, third-choice goalkeeper Wright. Manchester United signed both Wayne Rooney (left) and Luke Shaw as teenagers . The Champions League squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in England, but four of those must have come through the ranks at City. Boyata was their only club-trained player named this season. It will be a major problem for the club next season as their one-season punishment (for breaching FFP rules) to name a squad of 21 is lifted and they can name 25 again. These will be issues exercising the minds at the very top of the club. But whichever way they look at it, City have three options which carry a downside: . 1) Spend big on the best English players 2) Find their own from their academy or 3) Buy cheaper English players who might not be good enough. Daniel Sturridge (left) and\u00a0Jordan Henderson are two players Liverpool bought to boost their English quota . For option one, supply and demand is a problem. There are probably only three England players most people would call good international-class and therefore worthy of a place in the City team should they want to win titles at home and abroad. Hart is already there, Wayne Rooney is at Manchester United and presumably unattainable while Raheem Sterling would be a premium price. 'Can you get Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with \u00a3100million you can,' complained Manuel Pellegrini recently. No wonder City appear ready to open negotiations at \u00a350m. Kean Bryan is one of the young players at Manchester City who is tipped to go on to big things . Midfielder Kean Bryan ticks all the boxes for what Manchester City hope to achieve in the future. A box-to-box midfielder from Manchester, he joined City at the age of 11 and has gone on to be an England youth international at different age levels. Aged 18, he has played for Patrick Vieira's under-21 elite development squad this season, and played five matches in City's run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Youth League, a Champions League equivalent for under-20s. Been compared to Steven Gerrard. The last Mancunian to play regularly for City was Michael Johnson and he had to retire early after injury problems. Of the next generation, \u00a360m has been quoted for Everton's Ross Barkley, a huge price for unproven talent. Harry Kane would be an interesting target as would Everton's Under21 defender John Stones, who might represent the best value-for-money. Jack Wilshere has had injury problems. City's academy cost \u00a3200m but so far none has broken into the first-team squad regularly. Marcos Lopes is on loan at Lille and may move there permanently. Karim Rekik has played Champions League football for PSV. City will hope starlets like Jose Pozo, Thierry Ambrose, Mathias Bossaerts, Seko Fofana, Jason Denayer and Kean Bryan will become their homegrown first-teamers of the future, but they are unlikely to make a major\u00a0contribution next season. Bryan is novel and interesting, he is from Manchester and has been likened to Steven Gerrard. Ross\u00a0Barkley is one of the most hotly tipped players in England and worth in the region of \u00a360m . The third option is to try and sign any English Premier League player who is available. It might not be the best idea for the players themselves, Johnson said after he was sold to Sunderland that the move to City can turn sour for young players. 'It is a lot different when you don't play. The novelty wears off, definitely,' he said. Rodwell is now at Sunderland too, while Sinclair will make his loan move to Aston Villa permanent provided they stay up. Rose and Cresswell be warned. Making up the numbers at Manchester City doesn't necessarily help the player or club. PREMIER LEAGUE . Eight players in the 25-man squads must be homegrown. A player counts as homegrown if they have spent three years at an English club up to the age of 21. Squads can be supplemented by as many Under 21 players as clubs want. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Eight of the 25-man squad must be homegrown, four of whom must be club-trained ie have come through the ranks of the actual club they are playing for. Squads can be supplemented by Under-21 players provided they have been with the club for at least two years. SERIE A . From 2016, squads will be limited to 25 players (not counting Under 21s), four of whom have to have grown up in Italy and four of whom have to be products of their club's academy, similar to Champions League rules. Clubs are not allowed to sign more than two non-EU players in a season. LA LIGA . Clubs are not allowed more than three non-EU players in their squads of 25, or in matches. However, after five years, you can apply for Spanish citizenship and become an EU player, as Lionel Messi has done. There are no additional homegrown rules for EU players. BUNDESLIGA . Clubs need to include eight homegrown players, including four from their own youth academy, in their squad. But unlike the Premier League, squads aren't restricted to 25 players so they can still sign as many non-homegrown players as they like. There are no restrictions on signing non-EU players.

When names like Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell and to a lesser extent Adam Johnson were signed, he could barely disguise his contempt, feeling none of them would help him take on Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League. 'Ask Marwood,' he would spit out when asked about the club's transfer policy, referring to the club's then-football administrator Brian Marwood who was responsible at the time for buying players. Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been linked with a move to Manchester City . Mancini was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on, Marwood has a new role at the academy with a Spaniard, Txiki Begiristain, in his old job with the title director of football. And yet the dilemma remains the same: How do City buy enough top English players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking FPP (financial fair play) regulations again? It won't be easy and could explain why City \u2013 who have slumped to fourth in the league \u2013 are being linked with less glamorous names like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell. Good players certainly, but good enough? Probably not. It's a sobering thought that Rodwell made only seven Premier League starts in two seasons for City after a \u00a312million move from Everton. Sinclair started just twice after signing from Swansea and is currently on loan at Aston Villa. Plenty of things at City have been carefully planned and executed well since the club's owners from Abu Dhabi took over in 2008. (From left) Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, assistant manager Brian Kidd, manager Manuel Pellegrini and former football administrator Brian Marwood . The Etihad Campus is a glittering monument to football development and helping the community, while two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup is an excellent trophy haul considering where the club have come from. But one weakness has been in their approach to having enough homegrown players, lagging behind most of their rivals. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers and Manchester United bought Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw as teenagers. Most spectacularly, Liverpool bought players like Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling and invested in making them better. Spurs have brought through Harry Kane and Ryan Mason from their academy. Only Chelsea face similar issues to City. Homegrown rules are complicated and differ slightly between competitions. Scott Sinclair (left) and Jack\u00a0Rodwell are two English players who were bought by Manchester City . In the Premier League, you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25. Homegrown players can be born overseas as long as they have been at a club's academy three years before the age of 21. If clubs can't find eight, they have to reduce their squad accordingly, as Chelsea have had to this season. Under 21 players can be named in the squad in addition to the 25. City's six Premier League homegrown players are: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner and there lies a major problem for next season. Lampard is definitely off and Milner is out of contract too. Clichy has endured a poor season and City will want a new left-back while Boyata, a Belgian who has been at City since he was 16, is not good enough to win a regular first-team place. The feeling is he was only offered his latest contract because he filled one of the homegrown slots. Ditto, third-choice goalkeeper Wright. Manchester United signed both Wayne Rooney (left) and Luke Shaw as teenagers . The Champions League squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in England, but four of those must have come through the ranks at City. Boyata was their only club-trained player named this season. It will be a major problem for the club next season as their one-season punishment (for breaching FFP rules) to name a squad of 21 is lifted and they can name 25 again. These will be issues exercising the minds at the very top of the club. But whichever way they look at it, City have three options which carry a downside: . 1) Spend big on the best English players 2) Find their own from their academy or 3) Buy cheaper English players who might not be good enough. Daniel Sturridge (left) and\u00a0Jordan Henderson are two players Liverpool bought to boost their English quota . For option one, supply and demand is a problem. There are probably only three England players most people would call good international-class and therefore worthy of a place in the City team should they want to win titles at home and abroad. Hart is already there, Wayne Rooney is at Manchester United and presumably unattainable while Raheem Sterling would be a premium price. 'Can you get Sterling?

Model Chrissy Teigen was praised this week as she posted a picture of herself to Instagram showing off her stretch marks . Chrissy's fans were happy that she shared the picture, with one of them commenting that 'real women' have stretch marks . Chrissy, 29, posted the picture of her thighs which had clear stretch marks on them saying: 'Bruises from bumping kitchen drawer handles for a week. Stretchies say hi!' She received praise from many fans, such as Instagram user @saraelizabef \u00a0who said: 'Love it! Real women have stretch marks #respect'. Another follower, @emmalittle5, commented: 'I have so much respect for you! I have stretchies too and I appreciate someone being real about them and acknowledging them thanks.' Meanwhile, Pink took to Twitter to speak out against those who had commented on her weight at an event she attended to support a doctor friend. She said: 'I can see that some of you are concerned about me from your comments about my weight. 'You\u2019re referring to the pictures of me from last night\u2019s cancer benefit that I attended to support my dear friend Dr Maggie DiNome.

And Chrissy and Pink aren't the first stars to make comments about their bodies or to be keen to show off their more natural selves. Kelly Clarkson recently gave an interview to Ellen DeGeneres in which she said that she was used to being bullied about her weight . Recently Kelly Clarkson gave an interview to American chat show host Ellen DeGeneres in which she discussed how she had been facing criticism for her weight for years. She said: 'I\u2019m such a creative person that I yo yo. So sometimes I\u2019m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don\u2019t and I\u2019m like.. I\u2019d rather have wine.' 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' Kelly told Ellen, prompting applause from the studio audience. 'You know, if it\u2019s you, you\u2019re just like whatever,' she said. 'I think what hurts my feelings..... is that I\u2019ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you\u2019re big, I must be so fat to them.' In 2012 Girls star and producer Lena Dunham hit back after she was criticised for wearing a pair of short shorts on the red carpet. In 2012 Lena Dunham recieved harsh criticism for this outfit. She said she didn't think a thinner woman would have been criticised in the same way . Lena told her critics: 'I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' She said at the time: 'Last week I wore something to an event...a big top and little shorts, and a bunch of [blog posts] came out that I had been out without pants [trousers],' 'I actually saw it...'Love it or hate it: The no-pants look.' My mom...thought it was so funny. 'My boyfriend was like, 'People seem to be worked up about you going out without pants.' But I didn't go out without pants! I had shorts on.' Lena continued: 'If Olivia Wilde had gone to a party in...little shorts, she might have been on a 'weird dressed list' or been told her outfit was cute. 'I don't think a girl with tiny thighs would have received such no-pants attention. I think what it really was...'Why did you all make us look at your thighs?' 'My response is, get used to it because I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' Tyra Banks' weight has gone up and down over the years and the model says that anyone who doesn't like the way she looks can kiss her fat a** . Former supermodel Tyra Banks similarly hit back after she was subject to mean remarks about her fuller figure. She said: 'To all of you that have something nasty to say about me, or other women that are built like me, women that sometimes or all the time look like this, women whose names you know, women whose names you don't, women who have been picked on, women whose husbands put them down, women at work or girls in school \u2014 I have one thing to say to you. Kiss my fat a**!' In 2014 when she was criticised for her appearance at the Golden Globes actress\u00a0Gabourey Sidibe had the perfect response to her haters.

She said: 'I\u2019m such a creative person that I yo yo. So sometimes I\u2019m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don\u2019t and I\u2019m like.. I\u2019d rather have wine.' 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' Kelly told Ellen, prompting applause from the studio audience. 'You know, if it\u2019s you, you\u2019re just like whatever,' she said. 'I think what hurts my feelings..... is that I\u2019ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you\u2019re big, I must be so fat to them.' In 2012 Girls star and producer Lena Dunham hit back after she was criticised for wearing a pair of short shorts on the red carpet. In 2012 Lena Dunham recieved harsh criticism for this outfit. She said she didn't think a thinner woman would have been criticised in the same way . Lena told her critics: 'I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' She said at the time: 'Last week I wore something to an event...a big top and little shorts, and a bunch of [blog posts] came out that I had been out without pants [trousers],' 'I actually saw it...'Love it or hate it: The no-pants look.' My mom...thought it was so funny. 'My boyfriend was like, 'People seem to be worked up about you going out without pants.' But I didn't go out without pants! I had shorts on.' Lena continued: 'If Olivia Wilde had gone to a party in...little shorts, she might have been on a 'weird dressed list' or been told her outfit was cute. 'I don't think a girl with tiny thighs would have received such no-pants attention. I think what it really was...'Why did you all make us look at your thighs?' 'My response is, get used to it because I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.' Tyra Banks' weight has gone up and down over the years and the model says that anyone who doesn't like the way she looks can kiss her fat a** . Former supermodel Tyra Banks similarly hit back after she was subject to mean remarks about her fuller figure. She said: 'To all of you that have something nasty to say about me, or other women that are built like me, women that sometimes or all the time look like this, women whose names you know, women whose names you don't, women who have been picked on, women whose husbands put them down, women at work or girls in school \u2014 I have one thing to say to you. Kiss my fat a**!' In 2014 when she was criticised for her appearance at the Golden Globes actress\u00a0Gabourey Sidibe had the perfect response to her haters. She said: 'To the people making mean comments about my [Golden Globes] pics, I mos def cried about it on that private jet on the way to my dream job last night #jk.'\nSummary: "}
{"article":"American model Kendra Spears, who has been known as Princess Salwa since her marriage to the Aga Khan's son Prince Rahim, has given birth to her first child. The baby, a  boy named Prince Irfan, was born in the Swiss city of Geneva last Saturday and both mother and child are doing well. News of the birth, which was announced yesterday, has been greeted with joy by the followers of the Aga Khan, who, in a statement, spoke of his family's 'great happiness'. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Princess Salwa Aga Khan, pictured during a photo shoot last year, has given birth to a son . Ms Spears, a Seattle-born supermodel who has starred in campaigns for Diane von Furstenburg and Chanel among others, married Prince Rahim Aga Khan in 2013 following a four month engagement. The model, 26, had been considered 'the next Cindy Crawford' by her agency Ford Models, but has put her career on the back-burner since becoming wife to the 44-year-old royal. She follows in the footsteps of a string of American royal wives, among them actress Rita Hayworth who was married to Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan. Prince Rahim's younger brother Hussein, 41, also married an American, although his marriage to New Yorker Kristin White, 38, ended shortly after his brother's wedding in 2013. The Jordanian royals have also made a habit of wedding Americans, most famously Lisa Najeeb Halaby who became known as Queen Noor following her marriage. Happy couple: The royal is said to be doing well, according to her husband, Prince Rahim Aga Khan . Striking: Princess Salwa pictured left on her wedding day and right during her catwalk modelling career . Britons have also married into the Jordanian royal dynasty, most notably Antoinette Avril Gardiner, the mother of current ruler Abdullah, . Unlike the Jordanians, the Aga Khan dynasty do not have a country and instead lead the Imami Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b Tariqah, a Shi'a Muslim sect . Like the King Abdullah of Jordan, the Aga Khan, a title bestowed upon the family by Persian (now Iran) ruler Fath-Ali Shah Qajar in 1818, claims to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed. Prince Rahim's father Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini is the current Aga Khan and took the title aged 20 following the death of his grandfather, Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, Aga Khan III. A British business magnate and a racehorse enthusiast, he is responsible for adding to the family fortune, which is thought to amount to more than $800m. Not all of the money was acquired through commerce, however. Part of it comes from a tithe paid by Ismaili Muslims called a 'dasond' - the equivalent of 12.5 percent of each person's gross annual income.

Andrew Cuomo said Friday that more than 160 patients in nine days have been rushed to hospitals across the state for adverse reactions to synthetic cannabinoid, known as \"spice\" or \"K2.\" \"Spice\" and other similar synthetic drugs are often marketed as legal plant material coated with chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of marijuana, according to a statement from the governor's office. \"Since the exact compounds contained in synthetic cannabinoid products change so frequently, it's often impossible for users to know exactly what they are putting in their body,\" acting New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said. Symptoms after use have a wide range of severity, from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. Synthetic marijuana is popular among teens because it is marketed as incense or natural products to \"mask its true purpose,\" the health department statement said. \"Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption,\" New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez said. \"They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain.\" The recent surge is not isolated in New York; other states across the country have noticed similar trends. Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise of synthetic marijuana usage and said there had been 98 overdoses suspected to be linked with \"spice\" in the previous month. Mobile County alone has seen seven cases in 2015 so far, more than the entire previous year, the statement said. Mississippi health officials are also concerned that synthetic marijuana is on the rise. Ninety-seven  cases over an eight-day span in April were reported to the Mississippi Poison Control Center, a Department of Health press release said.","highlights":"New York reports 160 hospitalizations related to synthetic marijuana .\nGov.

{"article":"A Walmart employee has been applauded for his honesty after finding $4,400 worth of cash in the parking lot and handing it over to authorities, who returned it to its relieved owner. Brian Cassidy was picking up trash outside the store in Bangor, Maine on Thursday when he discovered the wet stack of money beneath a large piece of paper in the parking lot. He immediately contacted store security to tell them what he had found and, realizing it was a sizable sum, they then contacted the police department, Sergeant Tim Cotton said. Officer Dustin Dow went to the store to take the report and learned that a man had visited the security office last winter to claim he had lost about $4,000 in the parking lot. Great work: Brian Cassidy, right, is pictured being presented with a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin by an officer after he found $4,400 cash in a Walmart parking lot and alerted security . The man, who was later identified as Ou Chen, said at the time that he had put the money in an envelope in his pocket after leaving work at a nearby restaurant. He had intended to send the money home to his family, Cotton said. But after clearing snow off his car and driving home, he realized that his pocket was empty. Chen went to the security office to ask if the money had been turned in or if surveillance footage had revealed what could have happened to it, but nothing emerged. When Dow heard of the story, he went to the nearby restaurant, Kobe Steakhouse, and asked for the man, and Chen confirmed he had misplaced the cash. After counting the money at the station, the officer returned to the restaurant to give it back to him - and to take a picture showing him gladly accepting it. Returned: The money belonged to Ou Chen, who lost the $4,000 as he cleared snow off his car last winter after leaving his job at a nearby restaurant.

{"article":"Anyone who has witnessed a game of hockey or netball might disagree, but men really are more competitive than women, according to a new study. Researchers have discovered that male athletes are more driven by the desire to beat the competition than female athletes. Sportswomen tend to be more committed to aspects of their lives outside sport - such as their academic studies - than their male counterparts, the researchers say. The researchers found that male 5,000 metre runners are more competitive than women. Great Britain's Mo Farah is pictured above running to victory in the European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland . This may explain why boys are often seen as being more competitive. However, the researchers say that there can be a great deal of individual variability with some women actually showing greater competitive drive than most male athletes. Many reasons have been suggested to explain why women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies. Now, a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics, by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office, women like to be part of a team. The results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues\u2019 ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work, rather than that of a team\u2019s. Researchers from CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, analysed the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team. They found that less than 11 per cent of men opted for team payment, in comparison to 44 per cent of women. These individuals tend to be far less common in women's sport, they said. The study could have implications for other areas outside sport, such as in the workplace where greater gender diversity could bring advantages. Professor Robert Deaner, a psychologist at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, said they studied elite runners because it is a sport that is equally popular among men and women and there is no disparity in prize money. He said: 'Of course, we need to be careful not to assume that our running results will generalise to all sports or all domains outside of sports. 'Nevertheless, our findings do echo those from other studies, which show that even when men and women hold the same selective jobs, men are more likely to prioritize competing for recognition and status, while women have more communal orientations.' The researchers, whose study is published in the journal PeerJ, assessed the competitiveness of 1,147 long distance runners competing in the 5,000 metres in the US National Collegiate Athletic Association. They surveyed each runners motivation for participating, their training volume and their desire to compete at an elite level after college. US tennis player John McEnroe (above) was notorious for letting his competitiveness get the better of him . The study found that male long distance runners, like Mo Farrah (left), are more competitive than women, but there are some women, like Paula Radcliffe on the right, who are arguably more competitive than the men . They also compared runners who were competing NCAA's Division 1, Division 2 and Division 3. The researchers found that men were far more competitive at all levels than female runners. The sex difference in competitiveness was also just as large in the fastest runners in Division 1 compared to the slower ones in Division 3. Professor Deaner said: 'By social science standards, the difference we found - men and women differing by about half a standard deviation on competitiveness measures - is moderate to large. 'But this kind of a difference still means that many of the female runners are more competitive than many of the male runners.' Writing in the journal the researchers added: 'Women did report greater commitment than men to their academic studies, suggesting a sex difference in priorities. 'Therefore, policies aiming to provide men and women with equal opportunities to flourish should acknowledge that sex differences in some kinds of preferences and motivation may persist even in selective sub-populations.'

They also compared runners who were competing NCAA's Division 1, Division 2 and Division 3. The researchers found that men were far more competitive at all levels than female runners. The sex difference in competitiveness was also just as large in the fastest runners in Division 1 compared to the slower ones in Division 3. Professor Deaner said: 'By social science standards, the difference we found - men and women differing by about half a standard deviation on competitiveness measures - is moderate to large. 'But this kind of a difference still means that many of the female runners are more competitive than many of the male runners.' Writing in the journal the researchers added: 'Women did report greater commitment than men to their academic studies, suggesting a sex difference in priorities. 'Therefore, policies aiming to provide men and women with equal opportunities to flourish should acknowledge that sex differences in some kinds of preferences and motivation may persist even in selective sub-populations.' Serena Williams is known for her intensely competitive attitude, playing through injury and destroying raquets .\nSummary: "}
{"article":"Fighter ace: Douglas Bader's story\u00a0is to be told in a Hollywood film dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019 The story of how Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain\u2019s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough. But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019. Bader \u2013 who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 \u2013 was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as \u2018the most brilliant escape conception of this war\u2019. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp\u2019s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break \u2013 August 30, 1942 \u2013 the prisoners managed to fuse the camp\u2019s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a \u2018home run\u2019 back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the \u2018escape-proof\u2019 Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader\u2019s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA . As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book have been bought by the makers of 2013\u2019s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting.

{"article":"A Pakistani man suspected of killing his fiancee and nine of her relatives after they appeared to be reluctant to give her permission to marry - months after he allegedly murdered his own parents. The 25-year-old suspect, who has been identified as Gul Ahmad Saeed, is alleged to have shot dead his fiancee, her parents and seven of her siblings on Sunday, police have said. Their deaths came just months after he is alleged to have killed his own parents, brother and sister-in-law after they objected to the match. Frustrated: Gul Ahmad Saeed is alleged to have gone on a killing spree after becoming angry with people obstructing his wedding plans. Pictured: Stock image of Pakistani brides and grooms at a mass wedding . Saeed has been on the run ever since, but returned to his home town in town in north-west Pakistan at the weekend - at which point he is suspected of killing his fiancee's family with the help of accomplices. He is said to have been outraged over her uncle's dithering over the marriage. 'The uncle was being very indecisive about the wedding which infuriated Gul Ahmad,' said police officer Mohammad Jamil. Police were searching for the suspects but they were believed to have fled into the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, where government authorities hold little sway and police are not legally permitted to go. 'We cannot follow anyone there since it is beyond our jurisdiction, and our security would be threatened,' said Jamil. Fled: Saeed, 25, is now said to be in the semi-autonomous Pashtun area, on the border with Afghanistan . The killings took place in a deeply conservative area where women there are often discouraged from going to school and have little choice when it comes to marriage. Pakistani women are often killed by men who feel their honour has been offended in some way. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that 869 women were murdered in so-called honour killings in 2013, the last year for which data is available.","highlights":"Gul Ahmad Saeed suspected of shooting fiancee, her parents and siblings .\nSaid to have been 'infuriated' about her uncle's\u00a0indecisiveness over match .\nSaeed, 25, had already allegedly killed four members of his own family .\nHas been on the run from police since their deaths earlier this year .","id":"d0ae207ac01ba7915ffdae96aa12e6b63c5dd9bd","prediction":["This article discusses a tragic incident involving a Pakistani man named Gul Ahmad Saeed.

The 25-year-old suspect, who has been identified as Gul Ahmad Saeed, is alleged to have shot dead his fiancee, her parents and seven of her siblings on Sunday, police have said. Their deaths came just months after he is alleged to have killed his own parents, brother and sister-in-law after they objected to the match. Frustrated: Gul Ahmad Saeed is alleged to have gone on a killing spree after becoming angry with people obstructing his wedding plans. Pictured: Stock image of Pakistani brides and grooms at a mass wedding . Saeed has been on the run ever since, but returned to his home town in town in north-west Pakistan at the weekend - at which point he is suspected of killing his fiancee's family with the help of accomplices. He is said to have been outraged over her uncle's dithering over the marriage. 'The uncle was being very indecisive about the wedding which infuriated Gul Ahmad,' said police officer Mohammad Jamil. Police were searching for the suspects but they were believed to have fled into the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, where government authorities hold little sway and police are not legally permitted to go. 'We cannot follow anyone there since it is beyond our jurisdiction, and our security would be threatened,' said Jamil. Fled: Saeed, 25, is now said to be in the semi-autonomous Pashtun area, on the border with Afghanistan . The killings took place in a deeply conservative area where women there are often discouraged from going to school and have little choice when it comes to marriage. Pakistani women are often killed by men who feel their honour has been offended in some way. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that 869 women were murdered in so-called honour killings in 2013, the last year for which data is available.\nSummary: "}
{"article":"An Indian-style bungalow that was built in Sussex in the Victorian era and preserved to maintain its 1880s facade has gone on the market for \u00a31million. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park near East Grinstead has been lovingly upheld to how its first owners intended it in the 19th Century. With wood paneling on indoor ceilings and a large veranda at its front, the unique property is one of the first ever bungalows built in the country. It has gone on the market for \u00a3985,000, with historians eager to put it forward for listing to further protect its heritage. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park in East Grinstead has gone on sale for almost \u00a31million. The property is one of the last surviving bungalows in Britain that were built on the design of Victorian houses in India . An early photograph of the house shows how it has been lovingly preserved by its owners since its construction in the late 19th Century . Inside, original oak panelling adorns the ceilings and walls. The double height living room is one of the house's main features with a quirky gallery serving as a make-shift office . A sketch of the property's main sitting room shows how its Victorian design has been maintained to how architects originally intended it . Built in the 1880s by RA Briggs, known as Bungalow Briggs, the property is not all split over one level as modern bungalows are today. At the time the term was used to describe small, country homes used by the wealthy upper classes as a retreat to escape the heat of pulsing Indian cities. The design soon infiltrated British architecture. Briggs, a renowned architect, published his interpretation of the style in the 1891 book Bungalows and Country Residences. A hallmark of the traditional Indian-Victorian bungalow was a large veranda at the front of a property like the one found at Pleasaunce Cottage. Set over 2,542sq ft, the house has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and a cellar.\u00a0The main sitting room is double height with a gallery and the original inglenook fireplace. Its current owner has lived in the property for more than 30 years, having bought the house in 1983. Unlike bungalows as they are referred to today, the property is set over three levels. The original term was not exclusive to one-storey properties, instead referring to mountain retreats favoured by the Upper Classes . An architect's drawing of the property in the 20th Century. Historians are eager to put the house forward for listing to further protect its heritage . One of the house's most distinct features is its large veranda at the front. These were a common feature among Victorian properties in India . The house's current owner said she fell in love with its unique design and layout when she bought it in 1983 and has tried to preserve its character . Other unique features which make the property so notable are two stained glass windows that have Victorian messages inscribed on them . One of the four bedrooms in the house that is set over more than 2,000sq ft. Original oak and wood flooring has been maintained . The property has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and two bathrooms, one of which is en-suite. It is being sold for \u00a3985,000 . 'It\u2019s a great place, I fell in love with it 32 years ago and I still love it after all these years,' said Marian Parker, 60. 'The big drawing room is double height and has this little gallery which I use as a study. The room opens on to the veranda and is a lovely room with lots of light in summer but it also has an open fireplace and is really cosy in winter. 'It looks very different from the front to the back. From the front it looks like a normal bungalow but when you go round to the back it looks like a three-storey house because you can see the cellar.' With two stained glass windows and an original oak panelling in the hall and lounge, historians are eager to put the property forward to be listed. Dr Kathryn Ferry, an architectural historian and author of the book Bungalows, said: 'This is one of the earliest surviving bungalows in Britain and certainly one of the most important. 'What makes this one so significant is it was part of a bungalow settlement as if built in India on a hill station where the colonial British went to escape from the heat of the cities, sitting on their verandas in the cool breeze. 'There are a couple of bungalows in the development left but this one is the most original. 'Bungalows weren\u2019t about single storey living, they were more of a leisure house and this exemplifies that. Bungalows aren\u2019t just boring suburban homes. 'It is not listed but it ought to be. We can\u2019t put it forward for listing yet in case it puts off buyers. But hopefully whoever does buy it will appreciate its importance enough to support a bid to list it.' The house is being sold \u00a0by Hamptons International for \u00a3985,000 and has not yet attracted any offers. A view of the property from one of its gardens.

{"article":"The morning after the row the night before, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg barely exchanged a word in the first-class cabin of their Emirates flight to Dubai, en route to the next race in Bahrain. If the two Mercedes drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms, they are communicating only when they have to. While they kept quiet among themselves, both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a \u2018racer\u2019 and Rosberg is not. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg have both had their say on Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Winner Hamilton (centre) waves to the crowd as Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel shake hands . Briefly, the bones of the argument are these. Rosberg, who was beaten into second place by Hamilton, said his team-mate had been \u2018selfish\u2019 by slowing down while leading the race. It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third. The verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side. Rosberg fumed. Hamilton smiled, seemingly happy to have riled his title rival. But it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the Shanghai paddock on Sunday night. Both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior Mercedes management including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, team principal and technical director respectively. Hamilton went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour. Rosberg for 20 minutes, now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside. Then, more than two hours after the race had finished, Wolff was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists. It was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference. Rosberg (left) was clearly angry with Hamilton in Sunday's press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver (right) denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton (right) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He declared the talks \u2018positive\u2019 and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing. Hamilton then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try,\u2019 he said with passion, often repeating his words for emphasis. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try. \u2018They said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and I said, \u201cWell that\u2019s the difference between us. I want to win always.\u201d \u2018And I would have done everything to get past today. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn\u2019t quick enough. \u2018This is motor racing, man. Racing. Don\u2019t take away the fun of the racing. It\u2019s racing. I wouldn\u2019t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what Nico\u2019s point is. Where we are is that I just won the race today. I did the best job I could possibly have done and the team got a one-two.\u2019 Hamilton\u2019s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him. No neutral I have spoken to within Formula One disputes the world champion\u2019s rationale. Hamilton (centre) celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Rosberg (right) appears less pleased . Hamilton crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . \u2018Ultimately this is Formula One,\u2019 added Hamilton. \u2018I want the guy to be up my a*** if he\u2019s got the pace to be up my a***, and putting pressure on me. And if I can\u2019t defend it, I lose, like in Bahrain last year. I wasn\u2019t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever.\u2019 The greatest race of this young century, certainly. Both drivers are now spending a few days in Dubai before travelling to Bahrain for this year\u2019s race on Sunday. Before leaving, and without knowing what Hamilton had said, Rosberg offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video, on which he answered fans\u2019 questions. One asked if he was \u2018crying\u2019 \u2013 by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: \u2018You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I\u2019ll keep it in mind and I\u2019ll try to show respect when it\u2019s due going forward.\u2019 Hamilton in front of team-mate Rosberg during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg (right) speaks with Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff in Shanghai during the weekend . But why did he not push to pass Hamilton? \u2018It might not be so easy to understand from the outside,\u2019 said the German. \u2018But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn\u2019t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. \u2018So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that\u2019s what I was building up to. \u2018The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths. That\u2019s all down to me to be those five-hundredths quicker next time.\u2019","highlights":"A dispute broke out between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg on Sunday .\nHamilton finished ahead of his team-mate to win the Chinese Grand Prix .\nThe British driver said that he is a 'racer' and Rosberg is not .\nBoth Mercedes drivers are en route to Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix .","id":"081c05013d058366fbbe732c7d02e504802a40a4","prediction":["This article discusses a dispute between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, two Mercedes drivers, following the Chinese Grand Prix.

If the two Mercedes drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms, they are communicating only when they have to. While they kept quiet among themselves, both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a \u2018racer\u2019 and Rosberg is not. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg have both had their say on Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Winner Hamilton (centre) waves to the crowd as Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel shake hands . Briefly, the bones of the argument are these. Rosberg, who was beaten into second place by Hamilton, said his team-mate had been \u2018selfish\u2019 by slowing down while leading the race. It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third. The verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side. Rosberg fumed. Hamilton smiled, seemingly happy to have riled his title rival. But it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the Shanghai paddock on Sunday night. Both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior Mercedes management including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, team principal and technical director respectively. Hamilton went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour. Rosberg for 20 minutes, now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside. Then, more than two hours after the race had finished, Wolff was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists. It was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference. Rosberg (left) was clearly angry with Hamilton in Sunday's press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver (right) denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton (right) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He declared the talks \u2018positive\u2019 and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing. Hamilton then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try,\u2019 he said with passion, often repeating his words for emphasis. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try. \u2018They said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and I said, \u201cWell that\u2019s the difference between us. I want to win always.\u201d \u2018And I would have done everything to get past today. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn\u2019t quick enough. \u2018This is motor racing, man. Racing. Don\u2019t take away the fun of the racing. It\u2019s racing. I wouldn\u2019t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what Nico\u2019s point is. Where we are is that I just won the race today. I did the best job I could possibly have done and the team got a one-two.\u2019 Hamilton\u2019s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him. No neutral I have spoken to within Formula One disputes the world champion\u2019s rationale. Hamilton (centre) celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Rosberg (right) appears less pleased . Hamilton crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . \u2018Ultimately this is Formula One,\u2019 added Hamilton. \u2018I want the guy to be up my a*** if he\u2019s got the pace to be up my a***, and putting pressure on me. And if I can\u2019t defend it, I lose, like in Bahrain last year. I wasn\u2019t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever.\u2019 The greatest race of this young century, certainly. Both drivers are now spending a few days in Dubai before travelling to Bahrain for this year\u2019s race on Sunday. Before leaving, and without knowing what Hamilton had said, Rosberg offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video, on which he answered fans\u2019 questions. One asked if he was \u2018crying\u2019 \u2013 by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: \u2018You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I\u2019ll keep it in mind and I\u2019ll try to show respect when it\u2019s due going forward.\u2019 Hamilton in front of team-mate Rosberg during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg (right) speaks with Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff in Shanghai during the weekend . But why did he not push to pass Hamilton? \u2018It might not be so easy to understand from the outside,\u2019 said the German. \u2018But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn\u2019t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. \u2018So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that\u2019s what I was building up to. \u2018The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths. That\u2019s all down to me to be those five-hundredths quicker next time.\u2019\nSummary: "}
{"article":"Two goals within ninety seconds of each other was enough to spark an outbreak of fear and loathing rarely seen on this side of the Mersey. After more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of Tranmere's faithful finally snapped when Oxford moved decisively ahead, in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous Saturday's Boat Race. The loathing was directed mainly at manager Micky Adams, who was announced on Sunday morning to have left the club by 'mutual consent'. The Tranmere players look down after the final whistle, as the prospect of relegation looms large . This is how it ends in football sometimes: standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter, who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out. The fear involves dropping out of the Football League a week on Saturday after 94 years of membership, something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards. Adams departs with two games to go and after a 3-0 defeat against a thoroughly professional Oxford side the Wirral's only professional sports outfit are one point behind Cheltenham and two behind Hartlepool. Bitter ironies abound. Relegation to the National League \u2013 the grand-sounding new title for the Conference but don't be fooled \u2013 may partly be down to Prenton Park legend and ex-manager Ronnie Moore, sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence, and now masterminding Hartlepool's unlikely survival. And it could all happen under the ownership of former FA Chief Executive Mark Palios, knowledgeable football man and esteemed former Tranmere player who took over the club late last summer. Kemar Roofe celebrates scoring, as a professional Oxford side eased past sorry Tranmere . The battle between Barnet and Bristol Rovers to win automatic promotion to the Football League will go down to the last game. Barnet, who lead the Conference by one point, have a home game against mid-table Gateshead on Saturday while Rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom Alfreton, who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated. Rovers looked as if they would head the table after the weekend\u2019s games but conceded a goal with two minutes left to draw 1-1 at Dover. That put Barnet, who dropped out of the Football League two seasons ago, in the driving seat after a 1-1 draw away to Kidderminster. Grimsby are guaranteed a play-off spot, but one of Eastleigh, Forest Green and Macclesfield will miss out. It all seemed such a good idea at the time. Nobody questioned his judgement in October when, with the team bottom of the table, he replaced the inexperienced Rob Edwards with a seasoned operator like Adams. There was the odd dead cat bounce, but six months on they are still bottom after failing to keep a clean sheet for nineteen consecutive matches. The Mersey ferry displays a quicker turning circle than that shown by the home defence for the two killer goals that came just after half-time, but then a cause of that may be a lack of familiarity among players. A staggering 52 have been called up to first team duty this season. Adams played the selection and recruitment game like a man on the fruit machine, continually pulling the handle in the hope that the right combination would come up in alignment. The latest loan signing has been young Everton winger George Green who, when pulled off on Saturday after 60 minutes, could be seen haranguing some of his team-mates on the bench. It was not long after full-time that you could catch assistant manager Alan Rogers, part of a distinguished list of former Tranmere players who graduated to a higher level, stripping the paint from the dressing room walls. Micky Adams has left the club by mutual consent, with Tranmere bottom of the league with two games to go . Rogers \u2013 now in charge for the next fortnight \u2013 then had to deny that Adams's decision to dodge the media was of any significance. He then professed himself 'dumbfounded' by the team's performance. And so it unravels in desperate times. They had actually competed gamely in the first half, but were overwhelmed by anxiety when getting anywhere near the goal. 'It's not acceptable,' he said. 'We just don't look like scoring a goal. The players have got to start taking some responsibility. It's an easy option pointing fingers at the manager but the players have got to look at themselves, have they done enough? The answer is no. I was a player. You've got to stand up and be counted.' Marc Laird, well-travelled journeyman and among those fighting for his career, did not try to shift the blame onto the management. He just about summed up the sense of disbelief saying: 'It's a big club, when I joined in the summer I never imagined that we would be where we are.' The prospect of dropping out of the 92 is something uniquely grim in English football, especially for a club of this heritage, who shortly after joining the league gave a debut to 16 year-old local lad Dixie Dean. It was only in January 2013 that they stood on top of League One and early in the last decade reached the League Cup final plus three FA Cup sixth rounds. But they do not have to look far for examples of how there is no easy road back in the event of relegation. Aside from Southport and Chester there is Wrexham, not far across the Welsh border and a decent sized club, who fell out of the league in 2008 and have yet to return. There is a long trip to Plymouth next Saturday and then a last home game against Bury. The unpalatable odds are that the next stop after that could be somewhere like Braintree or Dover.","highlights":"Tranmere on brink of relegation from League Two with two games to play .\nRovers manager Micky Adams left club by mutual consent on Sunday .\nTranmere could drop out of Football League after 94 years .","id":"5faeb0deba46846c779a59694af4ea1110374f95","prediction":["This article discusses a football match between Tranmere and Oxford, which resulted in a significant loss for Tranmere.
