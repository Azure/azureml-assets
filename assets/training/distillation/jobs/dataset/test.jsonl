{"article":"England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the \u2018contest,\u2019 England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match . Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances . When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side\u2019s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England\u2019s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner\u2019s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid\u2019s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England\u2019s unimaginative one-day thinking. England\u2019s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.","highlights":"England reduce Invitational XI to 24 for six after amassing lead of 320 .\nHosts hold out for a draw, but the game had descended into a farce .\nEngland will learn little from glorified net against woeful opposition .\nJames Tredwell out-bowls Adil Rashid in contest to be Test spinner .","id":"d1c825891b2464e5af6ee3e0940687e551ef95e5","prediction":["This article discusses a cricket match between England and the St Kitts Invitational XI.

{"article":"Anti-Semitic attacks surged worldwide by 38 per cent last year, with the highest number of incidents occurring in France, an annual study has revealed. The report, by Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry, said 766 violent anti-Semitic acts were carried out around the world last year - marking a huge increase from the previous year. Arson, vandalism and direct threats against Jews, synagogues and other Jewish institutions were included in the figure, making 2014 the worst year for such attacks since 2009. The study said: 'The overall feeling among many Jewish people is one of living in an intensifying anti-Jewish environment that has become not only insulting and threatening, but outright dangerous. In particular, it cited 'alarming reports especially from Western Europe and North America'. Anger in Western Europe over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip last July and August, as well as anti-Jewish caricatures in the media and social networks had helped to turn anti-Semitism into an 'almost daily phenomena seen and felt in every sphere of life', the report said. In France, the number of anti-Semitic attacks rose to 164 in 2014 compared with 141 in 2013. In January this year, four hostages were killed in a Paris kosher supermarket in violence that began when Islamist militants carried out a massacre in the office of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly. Britain registered 141 violent incidents against Jews in 2014, after 95 a year earlier. In one of the most serious attacks a victim was called a 'Jewish c***' and then hit with a glass and a baseball bat in London. In Manchester, a man was knocked off his bike and kicked while on the ground by a group of youths who called him a 'Jew'. In January this year, four hostages were killed in a Paris kosher supermarket in an anti-Semitic attack . The violence began when Islamist militants carried out a massacre in the office of Charlie Hebdo magazine . And a Jewish girl had deodorant sprayed in her face by a 12-year-old fellow pupil who said to her 'gas the Jews' at a school in Edinburgh. The number of anti-Semitic acts in Germany and Italy more than doubled, to 76 and 23 respectively. In Western Europe in particular, the study said, 'the issue is not only a matter of having more security means provided by the respective states, but rather the ability to lead a full Jewish life... especially under heavy police and even army protection'. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stoked controversy in February when he called for 'mass immigration' of European Jews to Israel following a deadly shooting at a synagogue in Denmark. Under Israel's Law of Return, anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent has a right of immigration to Israel and, once there, can receive Israeli citizenship automatically.","highlights":"Anti-Semitic attacks worldwide have surged by 38 per cent, study reveals .\nFrance remains the country with the highest number of incidents .\nLast year it registered 164 anti-Semitic attacks, compared to 141 in 2013 .\nEarlier this year, four hostages were killed at a Paris kosher supermarket .\nBritain was home to 141 violent incidents, after registering 95 a year earlier .","id":"99aa7fdbe4c0aac8cc02997b5a028b7773423807","prediction":["This article discusses a study by Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center, which reveals a significant surge in anti-Semitic attacks worldwide, with a 38% increase from the previous year.

{"article":"Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson gives his predictions ahead of the 79th Masters at Augusta on Thursday. Best American . So many to choose from but given Augusta\u2019s predilection for a tale of redemption \u2014 from Vijay \u2018kiss my ass\u2019 Singh to Adam \u2018this one\u2019s for you, Greg\u2019 Scott \u2014 let\u2019s go for the reformed party animal Dustin Johnson. Time for him to prove he can match his gargantuan yardage off the tee with the requisite amount of brain cells. Dustin Johnson watches his tee shot during a practice round on the Augusta course on Wednesday . Best European (Non-UK) Not so many to choose from, alas. Indeed, given Henrik Stenson spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low, we\u2019re almost empty-handed. Still, let\u2019s hope the Swede can rise from his sick bed. Other than that, it\u2019s time Victor Dubuisson returned to the limelight. Henrik Stenson has only recently recovered from flu but the Swede will be hoping to mount a serious challenge . Best from the UK . Let\u2019s leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category. Lee Westwood has got an impressive recent record at Augusta and Justin Rose has shown he can play well here. But I have a feeling Paul Casey is the most likely to join Rory and get into contention come Sunday afternoon. Best International . You can hardly have faith in Adam Scott to emulate Bubba Watson and win a second Masters in three years given he\u2019s confused enough on the greens to be going back to the long putter. While Scott sorts himself out, compatriot Jason Day has an outstanding chance to grab another win for Australia. Jason Day has a great chance to become another Australian winner at the Masters . Best each way bet . When you think last year\u2019s joint runner-up Jonas Blixt is 150-1, there are some tasty odds out there. How about Padraig Harrington at 80-1? Or Bernhard Langer to finish in the top six at 400-1? My particular favourite is three-time Masters champ Phil Mickelson at 25-1. A steal. Phil Mickelson watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on Wednesday . How will Rory do? Given what it would do for the sport and what an achievement it would represent, I fervently hope Bubba Watson is slipping a size 38 regular jacket on to McIlroy\u2019s shoulders come Sunday night. But this might prove the major where he falls just short \u2014 and we have to wait a couple of years to enjoy his Slam. Prediction: Third . Rory McIlroy will begin his quest for a Grand Slam when the Masters kicks into action on Thursday . How will Tiger do? Not as good as some American writers believe, who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on Monday. Not as bad as the doomsayers think either, though. He should make the halfway cut\u2026 and maybe scrape into the top 20. Prediction: 19th .

Best American . So many to choose from but given Augusta\u2019s predilection for a tale of redemption \u2014 from Vijay \u2018kiss my ass\u2019 Singh to Adam \u2018this one\u2019s for you, Greg\u2019 Scott \u2014 let\u2019s go for the reformed party animal Dustin Johnson. Time for him to prove he can match his gargantuan yardage off the tee with the requisite amount of brain cells. Dustin Johnson watches his tee shot during a practice round on the Augusta course on Wednesday . Best European (Non-UK) Not so many to choose from, alas. Indeed, given Henrik Stenson spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low, we\u2019re almost empty-handed. Still, let\u2019s hope the Swede can rise from his sick bed. Other than that, it\u2019s time Victor Dubuisson returned to the limelight. Henrik Stenson has only recently recovered from flu but the Swede will be hoping to mount a serious challenge . Best from the UK . Let\u2019s leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category. Lee Westwood has got an impressive recent record at Augusta and Justin Rose has shown he can play well here. But I have a feeling Paul Casey is the most likely to join Rory and get into contention come Sunday afternoon. Best International . You can hardly have faith in Adam Scott to emulate Bubba Watson and win a second Masters in three years given he\u2019s confused enough on the greens to be going back to the long putter. While Scott sorts himself out, compatriot Jason Day has an outstanding chance to grab another win for Australia. Jason Day has a great chance to become another Australian winner at the Masters . Best each way bet . When you think last year\u2019s joint runner-up Jonas Blixt is 150-1, there are some tasty odds out there. How about Padraig Harrington at 80-1? Or Bernhard Langer to finish in the top six at 400-1? My particular favourite is three-time Masters champ Phil Mickelson at 25-1. A steal. Phil Mickelson watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on Wednesday . How will Rory do? Given what it would do for the sport and what an achievement it would represent, I fervently hope Bubba Watson is slipping a size 38 regular jacket on to McIlroy\u2019s shoulders come Sunday night. But this might prove the major where he falls just short \u2014 and we have to wait a couple of years to enjoy his Slam. Prediction: Third . Rory McIlroy will begin his quest for a Grand Slam when the Masters kicks into action on Thursday . How will Tiger do? Not as good as some American writers believe, who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on Monday. Not as bad as the doomsayers think either, though. He should make the halfway cut\u2026 and maybe scrape into the top 20. Prediction: 19th . Tiger Woods was joined by his girlfriend\u00a0Lindsey Vonn (left) and his two children on the course on Wednesday .\nSummary: "}
{"article":"A British couple who are believed to have fled their Berkshire home with their four young children in a bid to escape to Syria have reportedly been arrested in Turkey. Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four children were caught on CCTV boarding a cross-Channel ferry from Dover earlier this month. Thames Valley Police believed they arrived in Calais, France, before travelling south down through Europe in a bid to flee to Syria. However, a Turkish official claimed today that the couple had been arrested in Ankara and are currently in custody with their four children - daughter Zoha, seven, and three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one. Photos released by the Turkish government show Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) pushing prams for their young children. They have been arrested by police in Ankara as they tried to go to Syria . Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children have reportedly been arrested in Ankara, Turkey. The family of six have been missing from their home in Slough, Berkshire, since April 7 . The family, who were spotted on CCTV at Dover catching a ferry to France on April 8 (pictured), were not reported missing by their relatives until eight days later. Police fear they may have been trying to get to Syria . Malik, 31, who has fled the UK with his family, was pictured at a protest outside the Lebanese embassy in London in May last year holding a pro-ISIS poster. The large poster stated 'Stop Terrorism Against Sunnis' Earlier, British authorities had said that there was no suggestion the family was doing any fighting in Syria, and it was unclear whether they were sympathetic to members of the Islamic State group or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But earlier today, the Mail revealed how Malik was pictured waving a flag in support of ISIS at a demonstration in London last year. The photograph shows Malik - a member of the banned UK extremist group al-Mujahiroun - holding a pro-ISIS sign at a protest against the arrest of hate preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad in May last year. The picture, taken by extremism researcher Jacob Michelson, shows the 31-year-old standing outside the Lebanese embassy in London brandishing a poster which reads 'Islamic State Is Solution', with the first letter of each word highlighted to spell out 'ISIS'. Bakri, who led a number of hate groups in Britain before being kicked out of the UK, was arrested in Lebanon in May, and is believed still to be in detention there. Earlier today Ms Kiran's family made an emotional appeal directly to her, urging her to get in touch so that they know the family is safe. 'We would like to urge you, Sara and Asif, to make contact with us and let us know that you and the children are safe,' relatives said in a statement. 'Sara, we want to let you know that we love you - we miss you, Asif and the grandchildren. You are not in trouble, we are not angry or upset, and we just want you to return home safely.' Thames Valley Police said yesterday that the Malik family were last seen on Tuesday April 7 but were only reported missing to police last Thursday, April 16. Malik (left) and Dhar (right) are pictured at a protest outside outside Regent's Park Mosque in May last year . Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) disappeared from their home in Berkshire this month . Malik and Ms Kiran, who neighbours said usually wore the full Islamic veil, left home without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which a force spokesman said was 'entirely out of character for this family'. Police said the family boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais at 12.30am on Wednesday, April 8. Neighbours said the alarm was raised after at least one of their four children failed to attend school. Their grandmother was also seen looking for them and knocking on other doors in the modern block of flats where they lived, asking if anyone had seen the family. Neither Malik nor his partner have attempted to contact any family members or friends since, despite taking their mobile phones with them on the trip, police said. Police said the lack of contact led detectives to believe their reason for leaving Britain may not be legitimate. Deputy Chief Constable John Campbell said yesterday: 'Given the online rhetoric from the Islamic State encouraging people to travel to Syria, the direction of travel and concerns voiced by Asif's family, we are concerned the family may be seeking to travel to Syria.' Anjem Choudary confirmed yesterday that Malik had been a member of al-Mujahiroun, and described him as a 'champion for shariah' who regularly attended the group's events and demonstrations. The Malik family's last known address in Slough, Berkshire, was in the block of flats on the left of this image . Siddhartha Dhar posted this picture of himself with a gun and his newborn baby on Twitter shortly after arriving in Syria last year.\u00a0Dhar fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year . Both Malik and Dhar are believed to be followers of notorious preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured above) Dhar - one of Choudary's top henchmen - fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year while under investigation by Scotland Yard. He was one of nine men who were detained on September 25 last year on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting al-Muhajiroun. Just hours after publicly declaring he had arrived in Syria, Dhar announced he had become a father to a baby boy who was a member of the latest generation of Islamist extremists. He wrote: 'Alhamdulillah, Allah blessed me with a healthy baby boy in the Islamic State. He is another great addition to the Islamic State. And he's definitely not British.' In a picture posted on Twitter at the time, Dhar was seen posing with an AK47 in one hand and his new-born baby in the other while standing in front of a mustard-coloured pickup truck, wearing a thick military style coat and boots. Two other followers of Choudary who have left Britain to join a terror group are Abu Rahin Aziz, from Luton, and former NHS surgeon Mirza Tariq Ali. Aziz skipped bail before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End, while Ali was arrested for repeatedly assaulting a bystander at a rally and was reported to have been killed while fighting with the Taliban last month.

{"article":"Four genuine European heavyweights remain in the Champions League, a quartet steeped in history and silverware. Between Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Juventus, the big-eared trophy has been lifted 21 times. Any of those clubs would be deserving finalists in the Olympiastadion in Berlin on June 6. But for tension, intrigue, and the potential for high drama, the match-up that most appeals has to be Real Madrid versus Barcelona. Javier Hernandez's late winner against Atletico Madrid sent Real Madrid into the Champions League semis . Neymar scored both goals in the second leg as Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 5-1 on aggregate . Transporting El Clasico to east Germany would bring a defining chapter to a myriad narratives, raising Europe\u2019s grandest derby to a level not seen amid years of ebb and flow between the two Spanish behemoths. We have seen plenty of tangles in recent years, notably the Champions League semi-final of 2011, and some may insist the unseemly battles when the pair faced off 12 times in 19 months a couple of years ago became too much. But never have they duelled in the continent's largest match. That would crystalise their competition. It would be a fascinating game. Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League trophy and second in a row with Real . Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left), Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) They have only met twice this season, both times in La Liga. Real Madrid won 3-1 at the Bernabeu before Christmas before Barcelona's 2-1 win at the Nou Camp last month, so the appetite is not sated this campaign. A deciding third bout at Europe\u2019s main event would draw global crowds not witnessed before.

Bale celebrates at the Mestalla after scoring a wonder goal that won the Spanish Cup for Barcelona . Pep Guardiola could come up against his former team Barcelona after guiding Bayern into the last four . Then there's the undercard fights for supremacy: Gareth Bale, the world\u2019s most expensive signing on paper, vying with Neymar, the game\u2019s costliest player when all told; Karim Benzema, that deadly Frenchman, versus Luis Suarez, the indefatigable Uruguayan (both tied on six Champions League goals this season, by the way). Both teams have a trident attack to strike fear into their opponents. Whose will triumph on the biggest stage? It is an intriguing question to pose. Then we have Carlo Ancelotti trying to save his job by going for his fourth European Cup as a manager, against Luis Enrique, who has weathered a storm in his debut season to break the record for number of club wins (42) in a head coach's first 50 games. As a player he won La Liga with both Real and Barca but never the Champions League. Messi and Ronaldo have had many duels, and could have another one this season in the Champions League . Pepe heads home during Real Madrid's 3-1 win over Barcelona in the Clasico at the Bernabeu in October . Suarez scored what proved to be the winner when Barcelona won the La Liga meeting in March . Pep Guardiola facing his old club, the place he delivered dream football and two European Cups, would be tantalising \u2013 be we can have that in the semi-final.

The Trust is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of Game Of Thrones and Twilight, which have popularised wolf-like dogs such as Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian huskies. But many new owners are often unprepared to cope with the specific exercise and socialisation requirements of these breeds \u2013 and make a lifetime commitment to them \u2013 resulting in a significant number eventually being abandoned.\nSummary: "}
{"article":"A woman's noisy neighbour has issued a withering reply to her hand-written letter complaining about his hard-partying ways, claiming only the deaf and 'those buried in the cemetery' would have any concerns with the noise coming for his home. The man's sarcastic response comes after Melbourne-based actor, Lucy Gransbury, wrote a two-page rant claiming her neighbours were keeping her awake at night. Gransbury thought the good-humoured note worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken again just before dawn the following Sunday. So she followed up by dropping a thank-you card and some gifts over the fence to the seven or eight men who lived there because she was 'too scared' to knock on their door. But after a month of not hearing back from any of her boisterous neighbours,\u00a0Jershon Witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his Facebook page opening with '\u00a0My dearest Lucy'. Scroll down for video . After weeks of not hearing back from any of the boisterous lads, Jershon Witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his Facebook page opening with this photo holding her two handwritten notes . Witehira said although others may find her crazy he thinks Gransbury is brave and creative . 'I'm impressed by the lengths you went to creatively to get your point across and even more by the audience it reached,' he said. He went onto apologise for the\u00a0the' music festivals and comedy galas' and added that the deaf man and those buried in the cemetery 4kms away, that Gransbury had referred to, awake occasionally. 'There's probably people out there that think your crazy for what you done but not me I thought you were brave and I respect you for it,' he went on to say. He then took up Gransbury's offer of getting to know each other over a few drinks. 'We look forward to getting to know you also and about that G&T you mentioned let's do it.' But he saved the most hilarious comment for the end. \u202a'P.S We have a room for rent if you know anyone interested. P.P.S I'm deadly serious.' Lucy Gransbury dropped a thank you letter and gifts over the fence to her neighbours\u00a0because she was too scared to knock on their door after they had been quiet for an entire week . The good-humoured letter asks the seven or eight burly blokes not to throw a hand grenade over her fence . Although a week after her first letter the neighbours woke her at 4.30am when they arrived home, and again at 6.45am when their mates left, Gransbury decided after writing a list of pros and cons that the mostly-reformed dudes, who she fears could crush her 'between their shoulder blades' as 'they seem to be a gang', deserved to be rewarded. The note, which was posted on her blog and on the Mamamia site, began with thanking the\u00a0less-noisy neighbours for a quieter week and although their voices woke her on Sunday she was grateful\u00a0there wasn't the 'bass guitar song' interrupting her dreams about Prince Harry. 'You probably think I'm a bit weird and have too much spare time, and you are entirely correct.' The gifts included: . A burnt DVD of the pilot episode of Neighbours where Max Ramsay breaks up a party on his namesake street by 'yelling at the flamin' lot of them'. She then later reveals that the DVD is in fact blank and suggests they watch the scene on YouTube. Two chickpea cans with a piece of string so she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with them while adding that they must detach the string if they are having a party - not to mention remove the chickpeas for a more\u00a0effective communciation device. And in good neighbourly fashion - specifically chose chickpeas in case the burly blokes wanted to whip up some hummus for their next party. Last but certainly not least - Gransbury threw in some salt and vinegar chips because she wanted to share her favourite things with her dear neighbours. She signed off by saying she hoped they got a giggle out of her note instead of being insulted and throwing a hand grenade over her fence.

After she was woken by their voices on Sunday morning, she wrote pros and cons about the incident - Derpa is in reference to the man she used to regularly hear who sounded like he was constantly yelling 'derpa\" Gransbury took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the first lengthy and hilarious handwritten letter over their adjoining back fence before running off in hysterics. She posted the letter on her blog with the precursor: 'So if you never hear from me again, I've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours' sound system.' Gransbury chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of 'funk' in her letter that was also published on Mamamia website. 'Dear Noisy Neighbours, . 'There are some choice swear words I would like to throw at you, but in the interest of being neighbourly, I'm going to replace them all with the word 'funk'.

Gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics . She then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them 'all the funking time'. Adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for 'breakfast radio hosts, international flight passengers, and parents of infants.' Gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but wouldn't have been heard over the\u00a0revving of their friend's engine of their 'sh*thouse fancy ute.' 'They were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty, that I am worried that the man behind the wheel was: A) drink driving B) not sure how to drive C) brain damaged D) actually a potato.' She signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left' Her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear\u00a0one note on the bass guitar 'over and funking over.' 'I'm not sure if it's you, or perhaps a friend, but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling 'derpa, derpa, derpa, derpa' at the top of his lungs. Is he okay?' she asked sarcastically. She expressed concern that this man is either not sure how to be human, brain damaged or simply a moron. The music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before Gransbury had to go out and begin her day. 'Everyone in my street probably feels the same.\u00a0And the street behind us. And the deaf man in the next suburb. And anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away.' She also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the CD was actually blank\u00a0because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs . Gransbury said she bought this card because 'Shut The F**k Up' was not available in a large size . As the considerate neighbour, Gransbury\u00a0gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with the apt songs: Respect by Aretha Franklin, 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, 'All About The Bass' by Meghan Trainor, 'Stop Right Now' by The Spice Girls and Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars 'because it's just a funkin' good song, really'. But she later revealed in the note that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs. After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, she asked them to 'Grow up.

{"article":"Renowned fashion designer Collette Dinnigan has placed her luxurious Paddington home on the market after splashing out on a stylish waterfront home in one of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs. The four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property cost Dinnigan $4.45 million back in 2009, and is set to go under the hammer on May 23. After purchasing a lavish $6.5 million Watsons Bay property just last month with husband Bradley Cocks, Dinnigan is hoping for a cool $6 million when the lavishly renovated Paddington house sells. Scroll down for video . Fashion queen Collette Dinnigan has put her four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property on the market . The two-storey terrace home was built in 1880, and is set on 379 square metres of prime Paddington real estate. 'It's one of the oldest houses in Paddington, and the renovations are just stunning,' said selling agent Ben Collier for MsGrath Estate Agents, who is selling the property along with Will Manning at Ballard property. The international designer and her husband carefully renovated the property to be 'very sympathetic and in keeping with the period style, while still keeping it contemporary', said Mr Collier. Mr Collier said that the owners loved the combination of the house's proximity to restaurants and cafes, along with the unusually large terrace which makes the property an actual house. 'Most terraces in the area are around six metres, but the property's terrace is about twice that,' he said. Set back from the street in the exclusive suburb, the couple share their meticulously crafted home with children 10-year-old Estella and three-year-old Hunter.

Dinnigan has been a successful designer since opening her first store  in 1992 and sells her brand in New York, London and Hong Kong . The inspired reinvention of contemporary and period style offers a selection of casual and formal living areas, which extend onto a central courtyard area with stone finish and a leafy courtyard area. The French provincial style kitchen boasts a marble island bar, which flows effortlessly onto the outdoor entertaining area. The recently configured lower level master suite features a stand alone marble bathtub. 'The fact that the master bedroom is on the ground floor is unusual, and means that the owners can live completely on one level, as the guest bedroom and bathroom is upstairs,' said Mr Collier. 'It's a wonderful property for those who want the Paddington lifestyle but don't want to incorporate multiple levels,' he said. The bedrooms are a generous size, and have built ins, surrounded by a neutral colour scheme. The exposed sandstone walls and recycled wooden floorboards add to the feeling of rustic luxury.

The Property Observer reported the house was listed for about $8 million. It was sold by Ballard Property and Sydney Sotheby's Realty on March 18. In September last year\u00a0Dinnigan and her husband sold their Palm Beach home for $3.2million. The couple purchased the home in 2010 for $3million and went on to refurbish it during their four year stay.

The four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property cost Dinnigan $4.45 million back in 2009, and is set to go under the hammer on May 23. After purchasing a lavish $6.5 million Watsons Bay property just last month with husband Bradley Cocks, Dinnigan is hoping for a cool $6 million when the lavishly renovated Paddington house sells. Scroll down for video . Fashion queen Collette Dinnigan has put her four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property on the market . The two-storey terrace home was built in 1880, and is set on 379 square metres of prime Paddington real estate. 'It's one of the oldest houses in Paddington, and the renovations are just stunning,' said selling agent Ben Collier for MsGrath Estate Agents, who is selling the property along with Will Manning at Ballard property. The international designer and her husband carefully renovated the property to be 'very sympathetic and in keeping with the period style, while still keeping it contemporary', said Mr Collier. Mr Collier said that the owners loved the combination of the house's proximity to restaurants and cafes, along with the unusually large terrace which makes the property an actual house. 'Most terraces in the area are around six metres, but the property's terrace is about twice that,' he said. Set back from the street in the exclusive suburb, the couple share their meticulously crafted home with children 10-year-old Estella and three-year-old Hunter.

Dinnigan has been a successful designer since opening her first store  in 1992 and sells her brand in New York, London and Hong Kong . The inspired reinvention of contemporary and period style offers a selection of casual and formal living areas, which extend onto a central courtyard area with stone finish and a leafy courtyard area. The French provincial style kitchen boasts a marble island bar, which flows effortlessly onto the outdoor entertaining area. The recently configured lower level master suite features a stand alone marble bathtub. 'The fact that the master bedroom is on the ground floor is unusual, and means that the owners can live completely on one level, as the guest bedroom and bathroom is upstairs,' said Mr Collier. 'It's a wonderful property for those who want the Paddington lifestyle but don't want to incorporate multiple levels,' he said. The bedrooms are a generous size, and have built ins, surrounded by a neutral colour scheme. The exposed sandstone walls and recycled wooden floorboards add to the feeling of rustic luxury.

The Property Observer reported the house was listed for about $8 million. It was sold by Ballard Property and Sydney Sotheby's Realty on March 18. In September last year\u00a0Dinnigan and her husband sold their Palm Beach home for $3.2million. The couple purchased the home in 2010 for $3million and went on to refurbish it during their four year stay. The three-bedroom property was bought by The Castle actress Sophie Lee and her husband, CEO of advertising agency Host, Anthony Freedman. Dinnigan also reportedly has a home in Paddington and a holiday house on the south coast.\nSummary: "}
{"article":"Hundreds of payday lenders will be wiped out by tougher rules designed to protect customers, experts have predicted. It comes as Wonga, the UK\u2019s biggest payday loans firm, today revealed it racked up a \u00a337.3million loss last year following a significant reduction in UK consumer lending while it attempts to clean up its tarnished image. Revenues declined to \u00a3217.2million in the period, down by almost \u00a3100million. Wonga's executive chairman Andy Haste said: 'We know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry, but we're determined to deliver on our plans and serve our customers in the right way.' Hundreds of payday lenders, such as Wonga, will be wiped out by tougher rules designed to protect customers, experts have predicted . The City watchdog has forecast that just three or four payday lenders out of 400 will be left standing following the introduction of the rules in January. They include a daily interest cap of 0.8 per cent and stricter affordability checks to ensure customers can repay loans. The true picture should become clearer later this year, as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) attempts to weed out dodgy firms. Payday lenders have all had to apply for a license to trade and will learn in the coming months whether they have been successful. Robin Savage, an analyst from investment bank Canaccord Genuity described some of the tactics used by payday lenders \u2013 such as extending loan terms and adding interest to customers who cannot afford to repay - as \u2018evil\u2019. He said: \u2018If firms can\u2019t do proper checks and find customers that can repay them then they do not deserve to survive.\u2019 Wonga, has become a lightning rod for public fury over payday lenders.

It was also ordered to pay \u00a32.6million in compensation after sending fake legal letters between 2008 and 2010 to 45,000 customers who had fallen behind on their repayments. The City watchdog has forecast that just three or four payday lenders out of 400 will be left standing following the introduction of the rules in January (file picture) A charge of almost \u00a320million will be incurred by the firm to cover compensation as well as legal and administrative costs.

Its new chairman Andy Haste \u2013 brought in to clean up the business \u2013 has ditched the adverts and admitted that it will be smaller and less profitable under the new regime.

{"article":"Jordan Speith is in prime position to win the Masters, maintaining the lead during the final round at Augusta. The 21-year-old has begun the last day of the hallowed tournament\u00a0after setting a scoring record for 54 holes of 16 under par. He is playing alongside British contender Justin Rose in the final, showcase pairing, and will be looking to avoid the disappointment of last year, when he finished runner-up. Some of his American rivals, such as Tiger Woods, have slipped down the leaderboard. But others, including Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are still posing a threat. Jordan Speith, pictured during his final round on Sunday, is in prime position to win The Masters, taking a four shot lead into the final round at Augusta . He is playing with British contender Justin Rose, who began the day four shots off the pace . Spieth, who squandered a front-nine Masters lead on Sunday last year and settled for sharing second behind Bubba Watson, is the man to beat for the top prize of $1.8 million at the $10 million event. 'Last year definitely left a bad taste in my mouth,' Spieth said. 'Looking at trying to get some revenge. I've got a long way to go still.' The spotlight belonged to Spieth, who could break Tiger Woods' 1997 tournament record of 18-under 270 by shooting 69 in the final round. The former world number one Woods started the day some shots back, and caused concern on the 7th hole when he seemed to injure his finger. He then pulled up on the 8th tee, shaking off the same hand while his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watched from the crowds. If he wins, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in Masters history, five months older than Woods when he won his first major in 1997. Spieth could also become only the fifth wire-to-wire winner in Masters history, joining Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Jack Nicklaus in 1972 and Ray Floyud in 1976. Spieth is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds, but Norman squandered a six-stroke lead in making the greatest last-day collapse in major golf history and lost by five to Nick Faldo. Tiger Woods \u00a0waits to play a shot on the first hole during the final round. He started the day further down the field looking to make up lost ground . The former world number one let go of his club and shook his hand after hurting his wrist during after playing a shot in pine needles . His girlfriend, gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn, was spotted walking up the first way as he got his round underway . She has been on hand to support her beau at Augusta throughout the week . No player in Masters history has ever reached 19-under at any stage of the tournament but Spieth flirted with it Saturday, making four birdies in five holes to stand 18-under before a double bogey at 17 and a 10-foot par save at 18, and could threaten again Sunday. With 22 birdies through 54 holes, Spieth broke Woods' record of 21 in 2005 and is on pace to shatter Mickelson's Masters 72-hole birdie total record of 25 from 2001. But Spieth has not made the Masters a runaway. Rose, who closed with five birdies in the last six holes Saturday, is trying for a second major crown - 22 months after his breakthrough at Merion. And Mickelson is still in position to potentially become the second-oldest winner in Masters history after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won in 1986. Mickelson has only one top-10 in his past 31 starts but it was a runner-up effort at last year's PGA Championship. Mickelson won the 2004, 2006 and 2010 Masters, as well as the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 British Open. Should he win Sunday, he would match Faldo and Lee Trevino as six-time major champions.

On Saturday it was reported that the Dallas, Texas native has just bought $2.3million on a stunning Texas mansion and has a gorgeous girlfriend, Annie Verret, who also happens to be his high school sweetheart. Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Steven, Spieth's younger brother, is an athlete as well, and plays basketball for Brown University. Then there is his youngest sibling Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum, and who has played the biggest role in shaping her brother's career according to Spieth's mother.

{"article":"Former paramedic Crsity Collins had admitted that she used ice while driving and treating patients in an effort to raise awareness about the damaging drug . A former ice addict, who worked as a paramedic while high on the drug, has made her story public in an attempt to raise awareness of the illegal substance and the lack of support available for its victims. Crsity Collins was using crystal meth every day and spending up to $500 a week to keep up her drug habit. The 30-year-old, who took herself to the emergency room six times while suffering drug induced psychosis, has slammed health services for failing to offer her support despite claiming on numerous occasions that bugs were eating her eyes. 'Because I was awake all the time I had a staph infection, but I actually believed I might have bugs in my eyes and when I went to hospital, I was having drug-induced psychosis, I would say I had mites in my eyes or fleas or bugs, ' Ms Collins told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not once was I ever asked \"are you on meth or taking drugs or are you having a drug induced psychosis\" or \"should we get a social worker or a psych assessment\". 'I don't know if they were trying to protect me because I was in the ambulance service, but either way they shouldn't have been protecting me because firstly, I was dealing with people and patients and secondly, like anyone else I deserve the best treatment and care. 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor.' The 30-year-old said she was never offered support despite checking herself into the emergency room on six occasions (right) while claiming that she had bugs in her eyes (left) 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor,' she said . Ms Collins, whose addiction was fuelled by her post traumatic stress disorder and a borderline personality disorder, first began using illegal drugs recreationally, and first tried meth, while living in Darwin. However her habit ironically escalated when she attempted to escape the city an its 'party scene' by moving back to Launceston in Tasmania, where she rekindled a relationship with an ex-boyfriend who was part of 'the same sort of scene'. 'I didn't have any friends that weren't using drugs. Everyone had it around. Pills weren't easy to come across in Launceston, it was always speed and then ice took over,' Ms Collins said. 'It made me feel like superwoman - I could do anything and run on barely any sleep, so it became something I was using on a very frequent basis. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had.' Ms Collins has now been clean for nine months after seeking help from the\u00a0Department of Veterans Affairs . She said that it was when she and her now ex-boyfriend broke up that she became a daily user of the drug, even when driving and treating patients as an ambulance worker, but that none of her colleagues appeared to notice. 'I never felt affected. I never had any close calls where I could have put someone in danger. I was always very good at my job, very on the ball with patient care, and that why I was never suspected,' Ms Collins said. 'When I look back, I find it absolutely disgraceful. I could have had psychosis at any stage or changed my awareness or sense of judgement - it's such an unpredictable drug. 'I'd hate to know that anyone I know was being taken care of by someone that is hungover or on any form of drug that would alter their sense of awareness, let alone ice. 'But it wasn't until I started taking lots of sick days because my eyes were flaring-up form being awake all the time that anyone noticed something was wrong, and even then it was like they were more worried that I wouldn't have any leave left rather than that my health was deteriorating.' Sores from obsessive picking: She said that traking the drug used to make her feel 'like superwoman' Ms Collins has now been clean for more than nine months after finding free help with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which she was directed to by pure chance after being arrested. 'I was on my way to a dealer's house and got pulled over. My car was raided and they found drugs and when then let me out on bail to appear at court, a police officer who was a reservist said \"you need to get yourself together\" and told me to see Veterans Affairs,' she said. Unlike at the single out-patient facility in Launceston, which was run by nurses and social workers but had no councillors, Ms Collins found intensive help that assessed the root of her drug addiction and uncovered her mental health problems. She now has effective strategies in place with her councillor to deal with her borderline personality disorder and anxiety, which used to lead her to take drugs as a coping mechanism, as well as the post-traumatic stress disorder she acquired while working in Iraq as a medic for six months. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had,' Ms Collins said .

I'd be constantly looking for bombs on the side of the roads, it was a habit there and when I got home I couldn't get out of it.' She is not living with her family who provide her with emotional and finical support after she left her job and isolated herself from damaging social groups, and is actively looking for her next line of work. Ms Collins wants to use her story to raise awareness about the 'epidemic of ice users' in Tasmania, where she said middle and higher class users were very common . 'In Tasmania there is becoming an epidemic of ice users and ice related crime, so if it can help even just a few people, then I'm more than happy to share my story,' she said. 'It's not just the lower socio-economic groups in society that we should concentrate on, it's happening everywhere - the drug doesn't discriminate and it's happening in the higher class and the middle classes. You need to have money to use it. 'There's no drug testing in people that we hold in high regards, like paramedics, police and firies - pilots have to have drug tests and paramedics should be made to have these tests too.'","highlights":"Cristy Collins worked for the Tasmanian Ambulance Service in Launceston .\nShe used to drive the ambulance and treat patients while high on  ice .\n30-year-old, who is now clean, was never offered support by hospital staff .\nPost traumatic stress disorder from her service in Iraq and borderline personality disorder both fuelled her drug addiction .\nMs Collins has shared her story in an effort to raise awareness of the damaging drug and the lack of support available for addicts seeking help .","id":"ca3b2dc93f170f06e3a60fe7cd3243d204cc4b75","prediction":["This article discusses the story of Crsity Collins, a former paramedic who struggled with an addiction to ice, a form of crystal meth.

{"article":"Spain remains Britons' favourite destination to fly to, as it has been for more than 25 years, with its more than 34 million journeys in 2014 over double that of the next most popular, the United States. New figures from the UK Civil Aviation Authority shows 238m passengers passed through British airports in 2014, just three million less than the pre-recession boom peak of 241m in 2007 and 10m more (a 4.4 per cent rise) than 2013. As would be expected, most passengers (144m) fly to Europe which enjoyed a 5.4 per cent rise year on year in visitors from the UK. Perhaps surprisingly though, Germany proved a more visited destination even than France and Italy, which were all ranked behind Spain and the US and ahead of Ireland and the Netherlands. The United Arab Emirates also ranks in the top 10 countries British flyers most travel to and enjoyed the largest passenger increase in the past year with a 430,000 boost (7.4 per cent) to 6.2m. The UAE  ranked ahead of Portugal and Switzerland, who round out the top 10, and Turkey in 11th. While only the 12 most visited country by plane, Greece is the biggest improver over the past year with its 5.6 million incoming passengers from Britain a 13.2 per cent increase. While topping numerous polls as UK travellers' dream destination, Australia suffered the biggest drop in UK arrivals losing a third of visitors from 744,000 to 488,000. In Europe, the country with the largest fall in passengers was Poland with a minute drop of 0.1m to 5.2m. There has been a rise of 2.3 per cent in passengers flying to and from North America from the UK, which has now reached 21m per year. Travellers to and from other international destinations has now increased 3.7 per cent to 33.6m.

{"article":"Defiant Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing. The Ukip leader was booed by voters at Westminster's Methodist Central Hall as he faced claims he blamed all of Britain's problems on migrants. Pollster ICM, which was hired by the BBC to select the audience members, today defended its process 'using\u00a0random location selection techniques'. Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing . Mr Farage, pictured today, risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' The BBC stressed that the audience was carefully selected by an process, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process. Asked whether he had lost his temper, Mr Farage told the BBC News\u00a0Channel: 'I was very calm about it. I didn't lose my rag.' He said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market, something he said would be accepted by 'most rational people'. And he added: 'This is not the first time I've seen this. The night of the by-election that Douglas Carswell won in Clacton with a landslide, there was a Ukip representative - Patrick O'Flynn - on Question Time in Clacton and the audience were deeply hostile to him.' Asked if he blamed the BBC, Mr Farage said: 'Sometimes these things go wrong, sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps aren't as truthful on their applications as they could be. 'In this case, the BBC gave the job to a polling company called ICM who are famous for getting everything about Ukip wrong and that I think was the mistake. 'Am I going to make a complaint? I've got an election to fight. What matters isn't the 200 people in the room, what really matters are the millions of people watching on television.' Mr Farage's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching . Independent pollsters ICM were hired by the BBC to select the audience of around 250 people. After facing stiff criticism from Ukip, the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members. They were selected from a 20-mile radius of the venue in Westminster. The region was broken up into 30 small areas, and at least 8 people were chosen from each area. Each person was selected to reflect the 'composition of the UK population by gender, age, ethnicity, and social grade, and political protocols that reflected the balance as agreed between the broadcasters and the political parties', ICM said. A fifth of the people declared themselves to be 'undecided voters'. A 'small number' of SNP and Plaid Cymru\u00a0supporters\u00a0were\u00a0brought in from Scotland and Wales. ICM added: 'The recruitment approach replicated those used by ICM at all the 2010 leader debates, both the Clegg vs Farage debates last year, and the recent ITV debate.' Mr Farage was widely considered to have won the debates against Nick Clegg last year, after which the Ukip leader made no complaint about the audience composition. Last night saw five opposition party leaders go head-to-head in a 90-minute live TV debate. Mr Farage appeared alongside Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Green Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. During the earlier exchanges, the leaders on Mr Farage for his anti-immigration policies, attracting applause from the audience. Mr Farage was taken aback, and attacked a 'total lack of comprehension' from those watching and protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC'. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Mr Farage warned that foreigners arriving in the UK 'has directly contributed to the housing crisis'. But he came under fire for linking all of the countries problems to immigration. Green party leader Natalie Bennett took a swipe at Mr Farage:\u00a0'There is someone here on this platform who wants to totally demonise migrants and you know who I mean.' She hit back at claims migrants are causing a crisis in the health service: 'One in four doctors is foreign born, 40 per cent of NHS staff are foreign born. Mr Miliband said told Mr Farage: 'You abuse immigrants and those with HIV and then you complain that Ukip is being abused.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' But Mr Farage claimed the audience was biased against him: 'There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.' Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: 'Nigel, let me just say one thing. 'This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.' Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: 'It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.' But Mr Farage retorted: 'The real audience are sitting at home.'

The BBC insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process . Unimpressed: Ukip voter\u00a0Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had 'done a couple of stupid things'. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: 'It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. 'If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. 'She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate,\u00a0Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.

{"article":"A couple bought a Beanie Baby for \u00a310 at a car boot sale - and later realised it was worth \u00a362,500. Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan were selling a range of toys at the boot sale in Bude, Cornwall, when they spotted the purple teddy at another seller's stall. As a former collector,\u00a0Mr Flanaghan, 22, recognised the bear as a limited edition Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby - one of the most sought after in the collection which can be worth thousands of pounds. Scroll down for video . Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan (pictured together left) picked up a rare purple Beanie Baby for \u00a310 at a car boot sale in Bude, Cornwall - and later found out it was worth \u00a362,500 . The bear turned out to be one of just 100 made around the world, made in December 1997 for the Princess of Wales Memorial Trust. They are now selling it on eBay, with a starting bid of \u00a320,000 . But the builder was stunned to find out that the bear was one of just 100 made around the world - and that another version is currently listed on eBay for \u00a362,500. The pair are now hoping to sell the bear on the auction site and put the money towards a deposit for a house. Miss Rogers, 20, a beauty therapist who lives in Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'We couldn't believe it. We picked it up for \u00a310 and it could be worth tens of thousands. 'It's so hard for young people to get on the property ladder so we think this could really be a blessing.' The pair had gone along to the car boot sale on Bank Holiday Monday with Mr Flanaghan's parents where they sold some of his old toys, including Beanie Babies. Before putting the teddies in the pile, the couple looked online to check that none of the bears would count as collectors' items. The pair, from Launceston, Cornwall, are now hoping the sale of the bear will give them a deposit for a house . While online, they read up about a Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby, which can sell for huge amounts. The range was created in December 1997 - the year the princess died - to raise money for the Princess of Wales Memorial Trust. It includes a poem on the tag which refers to Diana as an 'angel'. But even when he spotted the bear at another seller's stall, Mr Flanaghan had no idea whether it was a 'first edition' bear - which are incredibly rare - or a second edition, which sells for just \u00a320. They later discovered the bear was handmade in Indonesia in December 2007 with special PE pellets and wording on the tag, which refers to the Princess Of Wales Memorial Fund - all of which make it a first edition bear. There is also a poem which reads: 'Like an angel she came from heaven above; she shared her compassion, her pain, her love; she only stayed with us long enough to teach the world to share, to give, to reach.' Another first edition Diana bear, the same as the one belonging to Miss Rogers and Mr Flanaghan, is currently being listed on eBay for \u00a362,500 . Miss Rogers said: 'Ryan and his sister used to collect Beanie Babies so before we sold a load we just wanted check that they weren't worth anything. 'As we were looking, we saw that this purple bear was the rarest bear and it was going for around \u00a320,000. We didn't think anything of it. 'But when we went to the car boot sale the next day, Ryan went off for a walk and came back clutching this bag. He said: \"It's that bear that we saw on the internet last night\".' The couple put it up for auction last night, with a starting bid of \u00a320,000. A spokesman for Beanie fan club Ty Collector said only a handful of people know how many Process Bears were produced. The Beanie Babies were first introduced to the public in 1993, when creators Ty Warner Inc, which later became Ty Inc, launched its original line consisting of just nine characters. Over the next few years however hundreds of different types of Beanie Baby were produced as they gained in popularity. The company made an empire worth more than $6billion from the toys, boosted by the increase in people buying them as popular collectibles in 1995. At the peak of the collecting craze, many believed the designs which had been 'retired' would rise in value. The craze however failed to last much longer than 1999. Nowadays hundreds of the cuddly toys are sold on sites such as eBay - but they are not always worth as much money as collectors would originally have hoped. However, there are some which have certainly increased in price, including the 'ultra rare' Ty Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby, first edition, which can be sold for tens of thousands of pounds.","highlights":"Leah Rogers, 20, and Ryan Flanaghan, 22, bought bear in Bude, Cornwall .\nThey realised it was one of 100 1st edition\u00a0Princess Diana Di Beanie Babies .\nRange created in 1997 to raise money for Princess Of Wales Memorial Trust .\nCouple listed bear for \u00a320,000 on eBay and hope to raise money for house deposit .","id":"c084f004f9001be13a4f2d836fa48165fa896b5c","prediction":["This article discusses a couple, Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan, who purchased a Beanie Baby for \u00a310 at a car boot sale.

{"article":"Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville has laid into\u00a0referee\u00a0Lee Mason after he failed to award Newcastle a penalty during their 2-0 defeat at Liverpool on Monday night. An incident in the 38th minute of the game, saw Ayoze Perez felled by a reckless challenge from Dejan Lovren. Although replays clearly showed the defender scything Perez down and not making contact with the ball, Mason did not point to the spot. Neville said during his analysis, 'It was an absolute stonewall penalty. The gasp in the ground, Lovren just kicks him right in the knee.' Ayoze Perez drives into the Liverpool box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by Dejan Lovren . Lovren makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball, sending the Spaniard tumbling . Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the Magpies at Anfield . He added that Mason's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call. 'I think we said it last week, in the game, we always look at the ref's position. But you look at Lee Mason's view of it and he's got no excuse, he's staring right at it there, he's so close, within five or six yards. It's just a\u00a0poor\u00a0decision.' Before Lovren's foul, Raheem Sterling had put Liverpool in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes; and Joe Allen wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from Mike Williamson. The misery was only to be compounded for Newcastle, as stand-in captain Moussa Sissoko saw red for a second bookable offence. With Newcastle trailing 1-0, a penalty could have offered them a way back into the game, but nothing was given .

An incident in the 38th minute of the game, saw Ayoze Perez felled by a reckless challenge from Dejan Lovren. Although replays clearly showed the defender scything Perez down and not making contact with the ball, Mason did not point to the spot. Neville said during his analysis, 'It was an absolute stonewall penalty. The gasp in the ground, Lovren just kicks him right in the knee.' Ayoze Perez drives into the Liverpool box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by Dejan Lovren . Lovren makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball, sending the Spaniard tumbling . Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the Magpies at Anfield . He added that Mason's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call. 'I think we said it last week, in the game, we always look at the ref's position. But you look at Lee Mason's view of it and he's got no excuse, he's staring right at it there, he's so close, within five or six yards. It's just a\u00a0poor\u00a0decision.' Before Lovren's foul, Raheem Sterling had put Liverpool in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes; and Joe Allen wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from Mike Williamson. The misery was only to be compounded for Newcastle, as stand-in captain Moussa Sissoko saw red for a second bookable offence. With Newcastle trailing 1-0, a penalty could have offered them a way back into the game, but nothing was given .

{"article":"They've steamrolled past top-four rivals Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in their current six-game Premier League winning streak, and Manchester United are looking to make it seventh heaven when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday. Ahead of the blockbuster clash at Stamford Bridge, the United squad were pictured travelling down to London on Friday afternoon. Led by captain Wayne Rooney the Red Devils' contingent commuted via Stockport Railway Station to the English capital. Wayne Rooney (left) and Ashley Young were among the Manchester United stars who made the trip to London via train on Friday ahead of this weekend's Premier League clash at Chelsea . Radamel Falcao (left) or Robin van Persie (right) could start up front for United vs Chelsea on Saturday . United boss Louis van Gaal  faces a number of selection dilemmas ahead of their clash against the Blues . It was earlier revealed that the 29-year-old striker may have to revert to a midfield role against the Blues after Michael Carrick and Daley Blind were two of four  United players ruled out of the clash due to injury. However, Van Gaal is able to call upon the services of in-form midfielder Juan Mata who is returning to the home of his former club for the first time on Saturday. Mata, who won three trophies in two-and-a-half successful seasons at the Bridge, posted a picture via his Instagram account as the United players boarded the train on Friday afternoon. Accompanied with the caption: 'I got back to London a few times, but this one it's different... Big game, lots of memories, great day of football!... #CFC vs #MUFC' United's No 8 was all smiles as he gears up for what promises to be emotional return to west London. Alongside the injuries of Carrick and Blind, United duo Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were also absent from the train ride - with the quartet all suffering injuries following United's 4-2 win over bitter rivals Manchester City on April 12. The club's injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho\u2019s side. And the latter was all smiles alongside Victor Valdes as they travelled down to London on Friday. Falcao is one of several selection dilemmas that Van Gaal and assistant boss Ryan Giggs have to make for the trip against Chelsea; in what the Dutchman described  as \u2018the worst scenario\u2019. Michael Carrick (left) limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo picked up an injury soon after .

Van Gaal (left) puts his arm round Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney during training this week . Van Gaal (left) has revealed that Rooney may play in holding midfield role against Chelsea . 4-1-4-1: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw; Rooney; Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Young; Falcao . \u2018I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that\u2019s not so good for us,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it\u2019s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones,' the 63-year-old said at United's pre-match press conference on Friday. \u2018That\u2019s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don\u2019t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don\u2019t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. \u2018Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It\u2019s always like that. It\u2019s not special in the life of a manager or a team. \u2018You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. \u2018It\u2019s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. \u2018Other players can take profit of the moment now. It\u2019s always like that. It\u2019s not special in the life of a manager or a team.\u2019 Van Gaal addresses the media ahead of Man United's crucial Premier League clash with Chelsea on Saturday . Luke Shaw hasn't featured under Van Gaal recently but should return to play at left back . Mata (right) is closed down by his Man United team-mates during a training session on Friday . Maroaune Fellaini will be hoping to continue his impressive form against Chelsea on Saturday evening . Fellaini (centre right) is embraced by his team-mates after scoring against rivals Manchester City last week . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Asked if Shaw could return for the first time since being substituted in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness, Van Gaal replied: \u2018Maybe you shall see tomorrow [Saturday]. You never know. Luke is fit enough I think. He has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don\u2019t like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough.\u2019 With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over third-placed United, Van Gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title. He also claimed that Mourinho will be happy with a draw. \u2018It\u2019s still possible, I\u2019ve said that before,\u2019 he added. \u2018It is not logical but it is possible. It\u2019s more when and if, and I don\u2019t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. \u2018But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea\u2019s shoulders. You never know, you\u2019ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. \u2018They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . \u2018We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That\u2019s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. \u2018To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine. That is why I\u2019m still a manager because I don\u2019t have to work anymore \u2013 you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.\u2019 Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend\u2019s work ethic. He said: \u2018It\u2019s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that\u2019s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. \u2018But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose. But to manage a group you have to work, and what I can see is that he\u2019s learning quickly.\u2019 Chris Smalling celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at Old Trafford .","highlights":"Manchester United travel to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday .\nRed Devils squad head down to London on Friday ahead of showdown .\nUnited have won six straight games prior to their meeting with the Blues .\nBut Louis van Gaal will travel to Stamford Bridge without several key men .\nPhil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Michael Carrick and Daley Blind are all sidelined .\nUnited captain Wayne Rooney may have to revert back to holding midfield .","id":"7a72d267603be3be1abd3ce25c680502d51121b0","prediction":["This article discusses the upcoming Premier League clash between Manchester United and Chelsea.

{"article":"A keen fisherman got more than he bargained for at the weekend when he reeled in a massive shark after spending hours battling the beast. Max Muggeridge, 19, from Coomera in QLD was camping at Tweed Heads just across the NSW border with his girlfriend when the pair decided to go for an early morning fish. An avid angler, Mr Muggeridge couldn't believe his luck when a huge four metre tiger shark took a bite of his line, and he spent the next three hours trying to bring it to shore. Scroll down for video . Max Muggeridge, 19, from the Gold Coast caught this four metre tiger shark at the weekend . He reeled in the monster on the Tweed coast just inside the NSW border, after a three hour battle . The massive creature is one of the largest tiger sharks ever caught off a beach, according to Max . 'Three hours on the rod and reel, it was both physically and mentally exhausting,' Mr Muggeridge told Daily Mail Australia. 'It definitely challenged my mindset and whether I had the perseverance to push through,' he added. 'We were just about to reel our rods in.. I started my car up and then my rod started ticking over.' The teenager, who is in his own words 'a shark conservationist first and foremost', also said the massive three hour battle left him with some serious battle wounds. 'I was absolutely shattered, I had blood blisters all over my hands, I've got some nice callouses coming up now,' Mr Muggeridge revealed. From the time he hooked the shark just after 7am, to the time he pulled it in around 10.30am the fisherman said it was a constant battle. In a post on Facebook, he described the ordeal in great detail, admitting that at times he wasn't sure if he had the strength to reel the monster in. 'The first hour this shark absolutely made a mockery out of me,' Mr Muggeridge wrote. The huge struggle with the shark left his antique fishing rod bent slightly out of shape . The 19-year-old said the catch was a once in a lifetime opportunity . Mr Muggeridge believes it could have been world record size but he wasn't able to accurately measure the beast . He was with his girlfriend Alexia (right) on the beach, who was snapping photos of him reeling in the shark . 'I was hurting bad, really bad. I've never been in so much pain. Sun burning in my face, shocking burns and blisters all over my hands, sweat and sunscreen dripping into my eyes, and my whole body aching from holding the intense pressure for such an extended time. 'Thoughts crossed my head like I can't do this, It's too big, I'm not prepared enough, I'm on my own...' the post continued. Mr Muggeridge said he didn't even get a proper glimpse of the shark until the second hour, 'when it jumped out of the water!!! What a sight, I have never seen that before!' The teenager also spoke to Nine's Today show on Thursday morning, telling the program he knew what he was up for about '20 seconds in... it definitely shocked me and my girlfriend (who) I was fishing with'. 'It absolutely blew everything I've ever caught out of the water so it was once in a lifetime catch,' he added. Mr Muggeridge said he thinks the catch could have been close to the world record, and he wished he could have measured it accurately. 'The current catch and release world record tiger shark held by Joey Polk is 10 foot eight inches (3.25m) in fork length and 12 foot 9 inches (3.88m) overall length,' he told The Gold Coast Bulletin. After getting a quick measurement of the huge creature, Mr Muggeridge sent it back out to sea . He is pictured here watching the huge creature swim back out into the ocean . Mr Muggeridge (left) and Alexia (right) were camping on the Tweed coast when they were fishing . Mr Muggeridge said he decided to release the shark rather than getting the measurements necessary to prove the record because the animal was in distressed after being landed. Photos show the young man in the shallows with the creature, dwarfed by the huge tiger shark.

Max Muggeridge, 19, from Coomera in QLD was camping at Tweed Heads just across the NSW border with his girlfriend when the pair decided to go for an early morning fish. An avid angler, Mr Muggeridge couldn't believe his luck when a huge four metre tiger shark took a bite of his line, and he spent the next three hours trying to bring it to shore. Scroll down for video . Max Muggeridge, 19, from the Gold Coast caught this four metre tiger shark at the weekend . He reeled in the monster on the Tweed coast just inside the NSW border, after a three hour battle . The massive creature is one of the largest tiger sharks ever caught off a beach, according to Max . 'Three hours on the rod and reel, it was both physically and mentally exhausting,' Mr Muggeridge told Daily Mail Australia. 'It definitely challenged my mindset and whether I had the perseverance to push through,' he added. 'We were just about to reel our rods in.. I started my car up and then my rod started ticking over.' The teenager, who is in his own words 'a shark conservationist first and foremost', also said the massive three hour battle left him with some serious battle wounds. 'I was absolutely shattered, I had blood blisters all over my hands, I've got some nice callouses coming up now,' Mr Muggeridge revealed. From the time he hooked the shark just after 7am, to the time he pulled it in around 10.30am the fisherman said it was a constant battle. In a post on Facebook, he described the ordeal in great detail, admitting that at times he wasn't sure if he had the strength to reel the monster in. 'The first hour this shark absolutely made a mockery out of me,' Mr Muggeridge wrote. The huge struggle with the shark left his antique fishing rod bent slightly out of shape . The 19-year-old said the catch was a once in a lifetime opportunity . Mr Muggeridge believes it could have been world record size but he wasn't able to accurately measure the beast . He was with his girlfriend Alexia (right) on the beach, who was snapping photos of him reeling in the shark . 'I was hurting bad, really bad. I've never been in so much pain. Sun burning in my face, shocking burns and blisters all over my hands, sweat and sunscreen dripping into my eyes, and my whole body aching from holding the intense pressure for such an extended time. 'Thoughts crossed my head like I can't do this, It's too big, I'm not prepared enough, I'm on my own...' the post continued. Mr Muggeridge said he didn't even get a proper glimpse of the shark until the second hour, 'when it jumped out of the water!!! What a sight, I have never seen that before!' The teenager also spoke to Nine's Today show on Thursday morning, telling the program he knew what he was up for about '20 seconds in... it definitely shocked me and my girlfriend (who) I was fishing with'. 'It absolutely blew everything I've ever caught out of the water so it was once in a lifetime catch,' he added. Mr Muggeridge said he thinks the catch could have been close to the world record, and he wished he could have measured it accurately. 'The current catch and release world record tiger shark held by Joey Polk is 10 foot eight inches (3.25m) in fork length and 12 foot 9 inches (3.88m) overall length,' he told The Gold Coast Bulletin. After getting a quick measurement of the huge creature, Mr Muggeridge sent it back out to sea . He is pictured here watching the huge creature swim back out into the ocean . Mr Muggeridge (left) and Alexia (right) were camping on the Tweed coast when they were fishing . Mr Muggeridge said he decided to release the shark rather than getting the measurements necessary to prove the record because the animal was in distressed after being landed. Photos show the young man in the shallows with the creature, dwarfed by the huge tiger shark. Snapped by his girlfriend Alexia, Mr Muggeridge said she was taking photos of him while he worked to get the marine animal back in the water and out to safety. He described the catch as a life-long goal, and said that by the end of the struggle he was completely wiped out. 'I collapsed on the beach and tried taking it all in.

For\u00a0The Superhero Project, Renee Bergeron, 38, photographs children with special needs as superheroes, dressing them up with capes, goggles, and wands in order to make them feel like they can do anything. 'I think a lot of people look at others with special needs and think of them as \"less\" in some ways,' Mrs. Bergeron, who also has a parenting blog, recently told The Mighty.

Powerful shots: Mila, left, suffers from speech disorders, while Mordecai, right, was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and has several missing fingers and toes . Mrs. Bergeron's first little superhero subject was her own son, Apollo, now four. Apollo was diagnosed with a rare heart defect when he was 18 months old and, in addition to undergoing several medical procedures and surgeries, had to be fitted with a feeding tube at a young age. Despite his health problems and the tube protruding from his stomach, when Apollo was two, Mrs. Bergeron said, he would pose for pictures with 'such strength and confidence'. His mother knew that one day Apollo might feel self-conscious about the tube, so she wanted to document him looking strong and proud, in the hopes that the images might inspire him to feel that way again later on in life. Proud princess: Victoria, pictured, was born with Congenital Femoral Deficiency, which affects her legs, hips, and knees . Super cute: Mrs. Bergeron's son Apollo, left, was her first subject; Melanie, right, is autistic, epileptic, and has Sensory Processing Disorder .

She continued: 'While their special needs are what brought them to the shoot, I wanted the images to capture their individual spirits.'

Rangers' Rod Wallace (centre) runs forward with the ball as his side are thrashed 5-1 by Celtic in 1998 . Advocaat had failed to recognise the significance of the Old Firm fixture and this led to a humiliating loss . He recalled: 'To be honest, I did not realise at that moment it was so huge. 'We lost that game and I remember saying in the press conference when they were really upset, 'It is no problem for me because it is just one of 38 games and we will not lose any more'. 'I would not say that anymore! But we became champions that year, six points ahead of Celtic, and won the treble.' Advocaat, though, does admit that his thoughts are trained on three points and not the notion of regional bragging rights. Indeed, the Black Cats are one point above the relegation zone and could be in the bottom three by kick-off. 'Every game is a chance to get a result \u2013 and that starts on Sunday,' said Advocaat, who could start Adam Johnson for the first time following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Sunderland's Adam Johnson was recently arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl . Advocaat is still considering starting the 27-year-old England international in the Wear-Tyne derby . 'If we win the fans might like me, yes, but I would prefer it if they loved me at the end of the season because that would mean we have stayed up.' Sunderland have won just twice at home all season. They have struggled amid an atmosphere of unrest at the Stadium of Light, but that should change tomorrow given the unveiling of Advocaat and the opponents. 'For us, this must be a weapon,' said Advocaat when asked about the home crowd. 'That is the reason I said it is so important to get them behind us, because it is an extra weapon.

{"article":"Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, stabbed victim Ian Garrod, 55, in the neck after meeting on the gay dating app Grindr . A drug-fuelled thug calling himself 'Gypsy Lad' slashed a middle-aged man around the throat with a kitchen knife after meeting him on the gay dating app Grindr. Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, carried out the attack after going back to Ian Garrod's home in Medway for sex in September last year. But when the 55-year-old sat on the bed, Dunn - who was said to be 'cool as a cucumber' during the attack - stabbed him  in the throat. Dunn, who was high on Class A Mephedrone, then left Mr Garrod in fear of his life, before fleeing from the property with his victim's wallet, iPhone, iPad and jewellery. The callous attacker even pretended to call an ambulance for his victim, but instead left him for dead with a 6cm-deep wound. He was later caught after police examined two cigarette butts found in Mr Garrod's garden - both of which had DNA linking to the attacker. Luckily,\u00a0Mr Garrod's housemate returned the the property and called an ambulance. The court heard it was only by the skill of a surgeon at Medway Maritime Hospital that the victim's life was saved. Dunn has now been jailed for 12 years after being found guilty of wounding with intent. He was cleared by a jury of attempted murder. Judge Jeremy Carey told Dunn he had narrowly decided against finding him dangerous, which would have led to an extended sentence. Judge Carey said Dunn was convicted of the wounding charge 'on the clearest evidence'. He said: 'You asserted you effectively were not the person who stabbed Ian Garrod and the jury found on the evidence you were and you intended to cause him really serious harm. 'It was hardly surprising since you cut his throat to a depth of 6cm. Only by the skill of a surgeon at Medway Maritime Hospital the flow of the blood was clipped and stemmed. 'Otherwise, you would have been convicted of murder.' The judge said there were 'inevitable uncertainties' about what happened that night. He continued: 'I am quite sure you did not attend there with the intention of committing acts of violence. I am quite sure something happened that night that caused you to lose it. Maidstone Crown Court heard how Dunn was caught after police examined two cigarette butts found in Mr Garrod's garden - both of which had DNA linking to the attacker . 'You say you don't remember. I don't know if you do or not. You are not a man prone to extreme violence. 'I think by a combination of a Class A drug you used that night and the revelation of something possibly to do with HIV on the part of Mr Garrod you lost it. 'You got a knife from the block and went upstairs and, cool as a cucumber, you slit his throat. Anyone listening to this must realise how serious this offending is. 'You made your position worse. You pretended to call and ambulance and stole items from him. It was a particularly callous thing to do to a man who lying bleeding towards fatality.' Judge Carey added: 'I am not going to make any comment about Grindr - about people who are willing to take in others they hardly know and have relations with them when drugs have been smoked. It doesn't assist anyone but it is a pretty shocking state of affairs.' Dunn, who has now been jailed for 12 years over the attack, called himself Gypsy Boy on the dating app . Dunn, who had previously been to Mr Garrod's home for a sex session, said in evidence he had 'memory blank' after being injected with Mephedrone. During his evidence he told the court he went to see Mr Garrod because he knew he could get drugs and sex. He said: 'At some point I had a glass of water and a couple of cigarettes. He tied my arm with an elastic thing he had and waited for my vein to come up, and he injected. 'I immediately felt really strange, like I wanted to be sick and like I don't know what I was doing. 'The last thing I remember him saying to me was: \"Just sit up straight and don't panic\". The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed at about 4pm. I don't remember how I got home.' Asked if he caused the wound, he replied: 'I can't answer that.' During his trial at Maidstone Crown Court Deborah Charles, prosecuting said Dunn had pretended to call an ambulance after the attack. She said: 'Mr Garrod felt as if someone had slapped him in the neck. 'He put his hand up to his neck and realised it was covered in blood. He never saw the weapon coming towards him. It happened too quickly. 'He just thought the defendant was leaning towards him, perhaps to kiss him or carry on what they were doing. 'Mr Garrod was begging him to call an ambulance. Mr Dunn pretended to do just that. He pretended to make a call and said an ambulance was coming. 'Mr Garrod was left lying on the bed with a wound that was life threatening.' At the time of the alleged attack Mr Garrod was living with a friend with whom he had previously been in a relationship. Miss Charles said Mr Garrod had spent the previous night with another man before meeting Dunn on the dating app. When Dunn arrived at his home he was said to have brought a drug with him which they both took. The court heard Mr Garrod regularly used a drug called Tina, a type of crystal meth, for sexual encounters.","highlights":"Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, attacked Ian Garrod, 55 .\nHe pretended to call ambulance before fleeing with victim's possessions .\nDunn caught after police found DNA on cigarette ends in Garrod's garden .\nHe has now been jailed for 12 years after being convicted of wounding .","id":"b8732349a46a96100b9c90307338082d9f28c6b3","prediction":["This article discusses a violent incident involving two individuals, Shane Dunn and Ian Garrod.

A drug-fuelled thug calling himself 'Gypsy Lad' slashed a middle-aged man around the throat with a kitchen knife after meeting him on the gay dating app Grindr. Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, carried out the attack after going back to Ian Garrod's home in Medway for sex in September last year. But when the 55-year-old sat on the bed, Dunn - who was said to be 'cool as a cucumber' during the attack - stabbed him  in the throat. Dunn, who was high on Class A Mephedrone, then left Mr Garrod in fear of his life, before fleeing from the property with his victim's wallet, iPhone, iPad and jewellery. The callous attacker even pretended to call an ambulance for his victim, but instead left him for dead with a 6cm-deep wound. He was later caught after police examined two cigarette butts found in Mr Garrod's garden - both of which had DNA linking to the attacker. Luckily,\u00a0Mr Garrod's housemate returned the the property and called an ambulance. The court heard it was only by the skill of a surgeon at Medway Maritime Hospital that the victim's life was saved. Dunn has now been jailed for 12 years after being found guilty of wounding with intent. He was cleared by a jury of attempted murder. Judge Jeremy Carey told Dunn he had narrowly decided against finding him dangerous, which would have led to an extended sentence. Judge Carey said Dunn was convicted of the wounding charge 'on the clearest evidence'. He said: 'You asserted you effectively were not the person who stabbed Ian Garrod and the jury found on the evidence you were and you intended to cause him really serious harm. 'It was hardly surprising since you cut his throat to a depth of 6cm. Only by the skill of a surgeon at Medway Maritime Hospital the flow of the blood was clipped and stemmed. 'Otherwise, you would have been convicted of murder.' The judge said there were 'inevitable uncertainties' about what happened that night. He continued: 'I am quite sure you did not attend there with the intention of committing acts of violence. I am quite sure something happened that night that caused you to lose it. Maidstone Crown Court heard how Dunn was caught after police examined two cigarette butts found in Mr Garrod's garden - both of which had DNA linking to the attacker . 'You say you don't remember. I don't know if you do or not. You are not a man prone to extreme violence. 'I think by a combination of a Class A drug you used that night and the revelation of something possibly to do with HIV on the part of Mr Garrod you lost it. 'You got a knife from the block and went upstairs and, cool as a cucumber, you slit his throat. Anyone listening to this must realise how serious this offending is. 'You made your position worse. You pretended to call and ambulance and stole items from him. It was a particularly callous thing to do to a man who lying bleeding towards fatality.' Judge Carey added: 'I am not going to make any comment about Grindr - about people who are willing to take in others they hardly know and have relations with them when drugs have been smoked. It doesn't assist anyone but it is a pretty shocking state of affairs.' Dunn, who has now been jailed for 12 years over the attack, called himself Gypsy Boy on the dating app . Dunn, who had previously been to Mr Garrod's home for a sex session, said in evidence he had 'memory blank' after being injected with Mephedrone. During his evidence he told the court he went to see Mr Garrod because he knew he could get drugs and sex. He said: 'At some point I had a glass of water and a couple of cigarettes. He tied my arm with an elastic thing he had and waited for my vein to come up, and he injected. 'I immediately felt really strange, like I wanted to be sick and like I don't know what I was doing. 'The last thing I remember him saying to me was: \"Just sit up straight and don't panic\". The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed at about 4pm. I don't remember how I got home.' Asked if he caused the wound, he replied: 'I can't answer that.' During his trial at Maidstone Crown Court Deborah Charles, prosecuting said Dunn had pretended to call an ambulance after the attack. She said: 'Mr Garrod felt as if someone had slapped him in the neck. 'He put his hand up to his neck and realised it was covered in blood. He never saw the weapon coming towards him. It happened too quickly. 'He just thought the defendant was leaning towards him, perhaps to kiss him or carry on what they were doing. 'Mr Garrod was begging him to call an ambulance. Mr Dunn pretended to do just that. He pretended to make a call and said an ambulance was coming. 'Mr Garrod was left lying on the bed with a wound that was life threatening.' At the time of the alleged attack Mr Garrod was living with a friend with whom he had previously been in a relationship. Miss Charles said Mr Garrod had spent the previous night with another man before meeting Dunn on the dating app. When Dunn arrived at his home he was said to have brought a drug with him which they both took. The court heard Mr Garrod regularly used a drug called Tina, a type of crystal meth, for sexual encounters.\nSummary: "}

'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes. 'I was shocked when Centrelink told me I couldn't get any more assistance because I'm a Kiwi. 'With what I currently get every fortnight, it's hard to afford even just the basic things.' Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard. 'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said. 'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder. According to the PKS Foundation of Australia, about 200 to 300 cases of PKS have been reported worldwide. About 15 to 20 are known to be in Australia. 'Most of these cases have been diagnosed in the last five years with an increasing diagnosis rate,' the foundation states. The condition is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is more commonly discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications. Symptoms include:\u00a0global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual impairment, seizures, marked hypotonia (floppiness), hearing and\/or vision impairment, difficulty in feeding and oesophageal reflux, congenital heart defects, apnoea, prominent high forehead, coarse facial features as child gets older, broad nasal bridge, streaks or patches of lighter or darker skin, sparse hair or bald patches, high arched or cleft palate, shorter arms and legs, disproportionate to the body and extra nipples.\nSummary: "}
{"article":"He's protected Russell Crowe, Naomi Campbell and Aerosmith rocker Steve Tyler, and now Cengiz Guven is protecting Australian travellers at Gallipoli. Mr Guven is the supervisor of site security at Lone Pine, the hilltop battlefield cemetery that will host the second Australian dawn service on Anzac Day. And while there have been questions about security at Gallipoli following recent terror arrests in Australia and ongoing instability in Syria, Mr Guven is quietly confident. 'The army is here, we are here. It will be okay,' he said. Cengiz G\u00fcven (left) with actor Russell Crowe in Istanbul during the premiere of Crowe's film The Water Divider . The 30-year-old security guard pictured with Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler . The 30-year-old security manager from Istanbul has been taking care of things at Lone Pine for the past four years, but in between Anzac Days his work has a superstar flavour. When Crowe attended the Istanbul premiere of his latest film, The Water Diviner, in 2014, Mr Guven was on personal protection duty. He kept Tyler safe when the frontman and his band were in town to perform and has been on duty for Campbell, American lifestyle icon Martha Stewart and electro-dance group The Prodigy. Switching from one-on-one to protecting thousands doesn't faze Mr Guven, even when the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings has made this year the busiest ever for him and his team from Turkish security firm VipSec.

Corporal Andrew Barnett of the Australian Army Band, who will play the bugle at the upcoming Dawn Service commemoration ceremony to honour Australian and New Zealand soldiers killed in the Gallipoli Campaign, stands at Anzac Cove on Wednesday . 'It's normally stressful but we are working here very proudly,' he told AAP as workers carried on with final preparations at Lone Pine. 'We can't look at this project like a business.' The civilian security team, which will handle bag and entry checks for 8000 Australians at the Lone Pine service on Anzac Day, is just a part of the enormous security machine that has swung into operation across the Gallipoli peninsula. Nearly 4000 national and paramilitary police, and at least 1000 Turkish soldiers will be on duty when the memorial sites are locked down over Friday and Saturday. More than 10,000 Australians and New Zealanders are expected to attend the Anazc Commemorative site at Gallipoli for the Anzac Day 100th anniversary commemoration this year.

{"article":"Bryony Hibbert (pictured), 25,  the girlfriend of the footballer caught having drunken sex in the dugout, has slammed those responsible for the clip . This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend\u00a0Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.'

The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage.\u00a0Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within\u00a0hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart, 24,  could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground.

{"article":"An author has claimed that 'people are ready' for his forthcoming play which stars impressionist Alistair McGowan as the disgraced paedophile Jimmy Savile. Journalist Jonathan Maitland said while there had been some shock at the drama, An Audience with Jimmy Savile, the majority of critics are eager to know when they will be able to see it. It will open in London in June, less than three years since the late comedian's depraved behaviour was exposed in a television documentary. Scroll down for video . The author of a play which sees impressionist Alistair McGowan portray Jimmy Savile has said the public is ready for it to be shown . The revelation that Savile had abused dozens of children and young women in hospitals and schools throughout the 70s and 80s sparked an enormous Scotland Yard probe into other alleged abuse. Although some lines of inquiry are still ongoing, Maitland claims now is an appropriate time to thrust the subject into the arts. In an interview with The Guardian he said: 'It has changed everything; it has changed the way we look at abuse, it has changed the way we prosecute it, it has changed attitudes towards it, the way we treat the survivors of it. 'What person would not want to explore what kicked it off?' Drawing on interview transcripts and statements provided to the police by some of Savile's many victims, the play's central role has been given to impressionist Alistair McGowan. Most often recognised for his comedic performances, Maitland said his leading actor is also 'terrific' at embodying the 'dark, nasty' elements of the story. In his popular BBC series, The Big Impression, McGowan included Savile in a bizarre comedy sketch in which he portrayed American rapper Eminem. McGowan previously portrayed the comedian in his popular series The Big Impression. In a sketch he responds to a teenage Eminem's repeated requests to appear on Jim'll Fix It . Twitter users rejected Maitland's claim the public was 'ready' for the play, describing the subject choice as 'unbelievable' Dressed in a blue and white tracksuit similar to those worn by Savile, McGowan writes to the Jim'll Fix It host to ask whether he could appear on the programme with his mother to whom he is violent. Later he impersonates Savile himself, responding: 'It would be hard to let you hurt your mum on the TV, especially at tea time.' Sinisterly, he then tells the fictional teenage Eminem that the pair could go to Alton Towers 'in a few hours' before giggling and licking his lips. Author Jonathan Maitland said people were 'ready' for the play to be shown less than three years after the abuse was exposed . Before opening to the public the play will hear findings of the Dame Janet Smith's inquiry into abuse at the BBC. While Maitland said he will be happy to adjust any contentious parts to its liking, he is confident the public, and Savile's victims, will be prepared for the drama. 'Yes it will be strange to see someone doing him for the first time, but I think people are ready.' Critics have however slammed his 'unbelievable' subject choice. One Twitter user said it was 'not quite right' to portray the scandal, while another commented: 'Why not make Fritzl the musical?', referring to the Austrian predator Josef Fritzl who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years to carry out horrific sexual abuse. John Caswell refuted Maitland's claim that the public were ready, responding: 'It's official, I am not people'. But a lawyer acting on behalf of 178 of the comedian's victims said she had met with the playwright and was satisfied the play had been produced in good taste. 'From what Jonathan has told me it will be extremely sensitive and will not in anyway undermine the seriousness of the subject ,' said Liz Dux, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon.

Last year, Greg de Hoedt, president of UKCSC, told the Guardian last year: 'The cannabis community is crying out for legalization and regulation. 'We encourage growers to register with UKCSC because we want data we can present to authorities and say: this many people grow cannabis, this many people are growing for medicinal purposes; and we can also establish which strains work with which illnesses.'
