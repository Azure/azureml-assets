{"article":"What the hell am I doing, I ask myself, as I stand shivering on the brink. It\u2019s April and my first proper swim of the year. The North Sea stretches before me. I dip a toe in. It\u2019s absolutely freezing . . . of course. I wobble over the sharp shingle, into the waves, until I\u2019m waist-deep. Gasping for breath, I take the plunge. And, within seconds, making frantic strokes, I\u2019m swept up and I\u2019m swimming. And it is glorious. Scroll down for video . Sarah Foot says her affair with open water began on Hampstead Heath after a local swimming pool closed down, and has taken her to swimming in the North Sea off the coast of Suffolk (pictured) I\u2019m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek, racing crawl -\u00a0I\u2019m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke . You don\u2019t have to be watching Poldark for a dip in the sea to set your heart racing. I love to swim. Miserable winters, exams, love affairs . . . I\u2019ve swum through them all, wherever I can find the water. Most of the time this means municipal pools from which I emerge reeking of chlorine and praying I\u2019ve avoided verrucas. So best of all has to be swimming outdoors, and here on the East coast in Suffolk it is now warm enough \u2014 just about \u2014 for the sea. And despite the greyness, the appalling cold, and the downright bleakness of the North Sea here, I\u2019m in heaven. The poet Byron \u2014 who was every bit as proud of his phenomenal swimming prowess as his verses \u2014 called the experience a \u2018buoyancy of spirits I never feel on any other occasion\u2019. I don\u2019t have to swim the four-mile-long Hellespont between Asia and Europe as he did to know what he meant. I, too, am buoyed up in every way. Yet I\u2019m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek, racing crawl. Nor am I that hardy chap I read about recently, known as the \u2018human polar bear\u2019, who swims round icebergs in the Arctic. A 30-minute dip leaves me exhausted. I can\u2019t even dive. You need look no further than Aidan Turner in Poldark to see how a dip in the ocean can set pulses racing . I\u2019m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke. But in the water I don\u2019t care. And, for me, that\u2019s the magic of swimming. I am completely free. For a few precious moments, all my troubles wash away. Nothing bothers me and my whole world flows \u2018swimmingly\u2019. Of course, it would be easier to get in if it weren\u2019t so damned cold \u2014 nudging a steely 8C (47F). Yet however enticing it is to bask in languid, tropical waters along with colourful fish, and laze about in Mediterranean and Caribbean seas, give me the Atlantic any day. Because, for me, the most perfect swim of all is in Scotland, off the Hebrides. What I love is the emptiness, the menthol cool of the water. On the Isle of Islay I have found deserted bays and swum completely alone or just with those I love, the sea crystal-clear and only the sound of the curlews and the water lapping over the rock pools. It\u2019s not warm, of course, but immersed in that wild sea is the closest to beauty I have ever been. Why does it affect me so? Freud, not surprisingly, had a view on a love of swimming. He believed it disguised a desire to return to the amniotic waters of the womb. But that\u2019s the sort of Freudian thing he would say. I prefer the thoughts of novelist Jane Austen, so much more restrained, who simply declared swimming \u2018delightful\u2019. She found the combination of sea air and sea water \u2018nearly infallible\u2019 and \u2018a match for every disorder\u2019. To the Romans, swimming was a most manly, heroic occupation, so much so that they defined an ignorant man as one who \u2018neither knows how to read or swim\u2019. Caligula, the cruel and brutally wanton Roman emperor, deemed himself a god but his contemporaries whispered he was a wimp \u2014 behind his back, presumably \u2014 because he couldn\u2019t manage a front crawl or even a doggy-paddle. I came across a similar attitude when I lived in London and finally plucked up the courage to swim in the famous, natural, spring-fed ponds on Hampstead Heath. The exclusive ladies pond is in a picture-perfect setting, surrounded by trees and wild flowers. But I was scared to go in. The problem was I couldn\u2019t see the bottom. The water was so black and deep, my thoughts would turn black and ominous too, imagining drowning and wondering how many rats were lurking in the murky shadows. But one day, the local indoor pool I used was unexpectedly closed. So I braved the pond. And it was a revelation. I felt I was swimming through silk. I never knew water could be so soft and I forgot about the rats and the unknown depths. And with all the passion of a convert I became so keen on the fresh water and splashing about with ducks I was determined to swim there all year round. Poet Lord Byron (left) was a prodigious swimmer, once crossing the four-mile Hellespont from Asia to Europe, while Jane Austen praised the sea air and water as 'a match for every disorder' I bought neoprene gloves and shoes and, as autumn came and the temperature dropped, I invested in a wet-suit. Because although there is something to be said for the way you emerge from cold water stinging and tingling as if heated by a feverish drug, I\u2019m not hardy enough for swimming through liquid ice. But, unfortunately, I was not allowed to wear my new wetsuit \u2014 \u2018not in the spirit of the ponds\u2019, I was told by the strict Hampstead matriarchs who police it. And my passion faltered and I had to wait again for warmer weather. The coldness of our climate meant that, for centuries in Britain, swimming in the wild for pleasure was considered close to madness. The sea and rivers were regarded as sources of disease rather than pleasure. And the Church saw swimming as a rather sinful pursuit, possibly because Romans treated it as the opportunity for more erotic activities than a few hale and hearty lengths. But then, at the end of the 18th century, George III gave swimming the royal stamp of approval by taking dips in the sea off Weymouth, accompanied apparently by a band who struck up God Save The King every time he popped his head out of the water. In 1824, Britain\u2019s first swimming society was formed by a group of Old Etonians. The David Camerons and Boris Johnsons of their day initiated non-swimmers by taking them out onto the River Thames and chucking them in. The Victorians had more gentle ways of learning to swim. A Boys Own Paper of 1879 suggested learning from frogs \u2014 by catching one, putting it in a bowl of water and then lying your body across a table and imitating the way it moved. George III brought swimming to fashion in England after years of scepticism from prudish members of the church . Whatever methods people learned to swim they were effective and, as more people took to the waters, something had to be done, in the name of modesty, about the habit of swimming naked. A cover-up campaign began, much to the annoyance of Francis Kilvert, a West Country curate who, in 1872, complained about the \u2018detestable custom of bathing in drawers\u2019. He loved \u2018the delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea\u2019. Forced to put on underwear (red and white striped) to conceal himself, he complained that: \u2018If ladies don\u2019t like to see men naked, why don\u2019t they keep away from the sight?\u2019 Indeed given the hysteria generated by Poldark actor Aidan Turner\u2019s quick Cornish dip, watching men swimming seems to be a pleasure that has never dimmed. Personally, I hate being seen swimming, though others clearly don\u2019t. On the nearest beach to me, the determinedly old-fashioned Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast, I watch doughty local residents wander through the town in great towelling robes for a morning dip, proudly showing off bodies leathered and tanned by years of immersion in the sea. They are following in the footsteps of the composer Benjamin Britten, the town\u2019s most famous resident, who extolled the virtues of cold water \u2018just to wake you up\u2019. On a good day, he\u2019d manage as many as five \u2018bathes\u2019, as he called them, fitting them in between rehearsals and lunch, as well as late at night in the moonlight. His love affair with water lasted through his whole life. He composed the piano piece Early Morning Bathe, which captures all the initial pain and ultimate pleasure of a swim off the English coast \u2014 that \u2018it\u2019s lovely when you\u2019re in\u2019 feeling. But the problem, for me, is the indignity of actually getting in and out of the sea. It\u2019s bad enough trying to keep your feet as you stagger in. But, unless it is unusually calm, there\u2019s not a hope of emerging from the surf with the composure of bikini-clad Ursula Andress in the Bond film Dr No. As I get out, the waves can be so pebble-filled-heavy I\u2019m often hurled flat on my face and have to scrabble over the stones on my stomach.\u00a0But the humiliation of looking like a seal heaving itself onto dry land is worth it for the joy of that swim. So I will continue to confront the North Sea, take delight when the temperature climbs a few degrees as we head into summer in the weeks ahead and then grit my teeth again as it plummets back into winter. Because I know from experience that, whatever the season, once I\u2019m swimming, I\u2019m reminded, however briefly, how wonderful it is to be alive.","highlights":"Sarah Foot began swimming outside after a dip on Hampstead Heath .\nNow goes for regular dips in the bracing 8C waters of the North Sea .\nSays nothing beats the 'silky smooth' feeling of swimming in cold water .","id":"201e23126e1529feacf1c1954fee6ad184797645","prediction":["This article discusses the experiences of Sarah Foot, who has developed a passion for open water swimming.

{"article":"Ed Miliband was accused of plunging the General Election campaign to a \u2018new low\u2019 last night by \u2018weaponising dead migrants\u2019. The Labour leader and his party\u2019s spin machine prompted the most bitter row of the campaign so far by suggesting that David Cameron bore personal responsibility for drownings of refugees in the Mediterranean. Senior Conservatives claimed Mr Miliband was effectively \u2018accusing the Prime Minister of murder\u2019 in a \u2018desperate and negative\u2019 attempt to score political points by exploiting a human tragedy. Ed Miliband, pictured, was accused of trying to make political capital from the Mediterranean tragedy . Ed Miliband claimed the Mediterranean crisis was 'in part a direct result' of the PM's Libya policy . The controversy began after Labour spin doctors issued a briefing note which said Mr Miliband would use a speech on foreign policy to say the \u2018tragic scenes\u2019 in the Mediterranean were \u2018in part a direct result\u2019 of Mr Cameron\u2019s Libya policy. The Labour leader later insisted he was not saying Mr Cameron had \u2018blood on his hands\u2019, but was making a \u2018very important point about post-conflict planning in Libya\u2019 after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi. The Prime Minister said only that Mr Miliband\u2019s remarks were \u2018ill- judged\u2019. But a senior Tory source said: \u2018A few bad polls for Labour after a poor week of campaigning and Ed Miliband accuses the PM of murder. I think we can see who is getting desperate and running a negative and personal campaign.\u2019 Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also condemned Labour\u2019s intervention, pointing out that Mr Miliband had backed Western military involvement in Libya. He accused Labour of astonishing hypocrisy, given the catastrophic failure of post-war planning in its Iraq conflict. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 5 live: \u2018I think it is quite distasteful, actually, to reduce this total human tragedy of hundreds of people dying out in the Mediterranean to a political point-scoring blame game, particularly, I have to say, from a party that of course brought us into an illegal invasion in Iraq where there was no planning at all for the aftermath.\u2019 Mr Clegg said there should be \u2018a little more adherence to the facts as to who is ending up on these boats, why they are and what we can do about it to stop this terrible human tragedy\u2019. Former foreign secretary William Hague said Mr Miliband\u2019s remarks represented \u2018a new low in shallow opportunism\u2019, given that the Labour leader had said \u2018nothing\u2019 about foreign policy for five years. Former Tory minister Richard Benyon accused Mr Miliband of \u2018weaponising dead migrants\u2019. He said a large percentage of those fleeing North Africa \u2018come from other countries than Libya so Miliband is wrong on every level\u2019. And former defence secretary Liam Fox said: \u2018Having tried to weaponise the NHS, Miliband is trying to weaponise drowning migrants. It\u2019s quite offensive and reflects extremely badly on both him and his party.\u2019 Mr Miliband, speaking at the Chatham House think-tank in London, was forced to deny that he had \u2018politicised\u2019 a tragedy. Former defence secretary Liam Fox said Miliband was trying to 'weaponise drowning migrants' Asked if that was true, Mr Miliband replied: \u2018Nonsense. No. Look, what this is about is saying very clearly to the British people that there is a huge issue we face as a country which is learning the lessons of the 2003 Iraq War. \u2018The problem is that in relation to Libya we have repeated the mistake because we haven\u2019t done the post-conflict planning. \u2018I think people should just read my words and I don\u2019t think anybody in the foreign policy community or in the wider international community would disagree with what I\u2019ve said about the failure of post-conflict planning.\u2019 Labour aides pointed out that Mr Miliband did raise the issue of post-war plans after supporting bombing raids in Libya in 2011. But footage of him also emerged from the same year suggesting the new Libyan authorities should be left to get on with it. \u2018This is an important moment to recognise the National Transitional Council and their role in taking Libya forward, and we\u2019ve got to be led by them. It\u2019s very important that Libyans determine their future,\u2019 he said at the time. Labour\u2019s shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker was forced to concede that Mr Cameron is not responsible for migrant deaths in the Mediterranean. \u2018Nobody would want to say that the Prime Minister, as a human being, would want to see the terrible things we have seen in the Med,\u2019 he said.

The Labour leader and his party\u2019s spin machine prompted the most bitter row of the campaign so far by suggesting that David Cameron bore personal responsibility for drownings of refugees in the Mediterranean. Senior Conservatives claimed Mr Miliband was effectively \u2018accusing the Prime Minister of murder\u2019 in a \u2018desperate and negative\u2019 attempt to score political points by exploiting a human tragedy. Ed Miliband, pictured, was accused of trying to make political capital from the Mediterranean tragedy . Ed Miliband claimed the Mediterranean crisis was 'in part a direct result' of the PM's Libya policy . The controversy began after Labour spin doctors issued a briefing note which said Mr Miliband would use a speech on foreign policy to say the \u2018tragic scenes\u2019 in the Mediterranean were \u2018in part a direct result\u2019 of Mr Cameron\u2019s Libya policy. The Labour leader later insisted he was not saying Mr Cameron had \u2018blood on his hands\u2019, but was making a \u2018very important point about post-conflict planning in Libya\u2019 after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi. The Prime Minister said only that Mr Miliband\u2019s remarks were \u2018ill- judged\u2019. But a senior Tory source said: \u2018A few bad polls for Labour after a poor week of campaigning and Ed Miliband accuses the PM of murder. I think we can see who is getting desperate and running a negative and personal campaign.\u2019 Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also condemned Labour\u2019s intervention, pointing out that Mr Miliband had backed Western military involvement in Libya. He accused Labour of astonishing hypocrisy, given the catastrophic failure of post-war planning in its Iraq conflict. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 5 live: \u2018I think it is quite distasteful, actually, to reduce this total human tragedy of hundreds of people dying out in the Mediterranean to a political point-scoring blame game, particularly, I have to say, from a party that of course brought us into an illegal invasion in Iraq where there was no planning at all for the aftermath.\u2019 Mr Clegg said there should be \u2018a little more adherence to the facts as to who is ending up on these boats, why they are and what we can do about it to stop this terrible human tragedy\u2019. Former foreign secretary William Hague said Mr Miliband\u2019s remarks represented \u2018a new low in shallow opportunism\u2019, given that the Labour leader had said \u2018nothing\u2019 about foreign policy for five years. Former Tory minister Richard Benyon accused Mr Miliband of \u2018weaponising dead migrants\u2019. He said a large percentage of those fleeing North Africa \u2018come from other countries than Libya so Miliband is wrong on every level\u2019. And former defence secretary Liam Fox said: \u2018Having tried to weaponise the NHS, Miliband is trying to weaponise drowning migrants. It\u2019s quite offensive and reflects extremely badly on both him and his party.\u2019 Mr Miliband, speaking at the Chatham House think-tank in London, was forced to deny that he had \u2018politicised\u2019 a tragedy. Former defence secretary Liam Fox said Miliband was trying to 'weaponise drowning migrants' Asked if that was true, Mr Miliband replied: \u2018Nonsense. No. Look, what this is about is saying very clearly to the British people that there is a huge issue we face as a country which is learning the lessons of the 2003 Iraq War. \u2018The problem is that in relation to Libya we have repeated the mistake because we haven\u2019t done the post-conflict planning. \u2018I think people should just read my words and I don\u2019t think anybody in the foreign policy community or in the wider international community would disagree with what I\u2019ve said about the failure of post-conflict planning.\u2019 Labour aides pointed out that Mr Miliband did raise the issue of post-war plans after supporting bombing raids in Libya in 2011. But footage of him also emerged from the same year suggesting the new Libyan authorities should be left to get on with it. \u2018This is an important moment to recognise the National Transitional Council and their role in taking Libya forward, and we\u2019ve got to be led by them. It\u2019s very important that Libyans determine their future,\u2019 he said at the time. Labour\u2019s shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker was forced to concede that Mr Cameron is not responsible for migrant deaths in the Mediterranean. \u2018Nobody would want to say that the Prime Minister, as a human being, would want to see the terrible things we have seen in the Med,\u2019 he said. In a bruising interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, Mr Coaker also struggled to explain when Mr Miliband had raised \u2018consistent concerns\u2019 about the issue of post-conflict planning.

{"article":"Kent Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","highlights":"Kent Sprouse, 42, faces lethal injection at 6pm Thursday .\nIn 2002 he gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas and a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38 .\nSprouse was high on meth, but his insanity defense was rejected .\nHe was sentenced to death in 2004 .\nSprouse has not appealed the sentence recently .\nIt could be the last execution in Texas for a while .\nThe state has a shortage the lethal drug pentobarbital .","id":"1997b4f4d49b7d0655ceb3f87bbc92996e382bd4","prediction":["This article discusses the case of Kent Sprouse, who was convicted for the murder of Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt and a customer named Pedro Moreno at a convenience store in Dallas.

A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.\nSummary: "}
{"article":"Almost three years after nearly leaving Liverpool Jordan Henderson has committed his long-term future to the club convinced he can win silverware at Anfield. Late in the summer of 2012, just a couple of months into the reign of Brendan Rodgers, he was lined up as makeweight in a failed bid to sign Fulham's Clint Dempsey only for the midfielder to reject the move. His determination to prove himself, and justify the \u00a316million price tag which came with him from Sunderland the previous summer, has been rewarded not only with a new five-year \u00a3100,000-a-week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain's armband from Steven Gerrard when he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. Jordan Henderson is 'over the moon' after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool . The club's vice-captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Liverpool until 2020 . Henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when Steven Gerrard leaves . But it is the unfulfilled potential which persuaded the 24-year-old England international to commit what should be the best years of his career to the club. 'A few years ago I had an opportunity to leave but I always knew how big this club is and I wanted to stay here for as long as possible - and nothing has changed since then,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'I feel as though I have got a good connection with the club now and there was no doubt where my future was going to be and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out. 'I have been through difficult times but I would never change that because I know there will be more difficult times ahead and I'll have to use that and I'll be able to handle it a lot better. 'Hopefully we've got many years ahead of winning trophies. 'I'm the same as every other player, I want to be playing at the highest level - in the Champions League, winning trophies and being very successful. 'I had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright, I was very pleased with what I was hearing.

When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g - carers have watched them grow to 1.1kg . They're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean,\u00a0then they might be moved on to solids by the carers . 'We've been keeping Scrumpy separate as he's older than the two girls. Once they start to mouth things, they start playing with each other, pulling ears, Scrumpy can get a bit rough though.' 'They're still on bottles now, we've started putting in custard creams to see if they're interested, then we might move them on to solids. 'They're in the cubby hole in my kitchen now.' The aim is to release the animals back into the wild once they're strong enough. They're all vaccinated against Bovine TB, before they reduce human contact. Pauline said: 'We'll add another two to the group, we'll keep them together before release in autumn. 'When they're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, they go down to the Millie Block, which is a separate building. 'After that they turn nocturnal, we feed them at night, then it's on to glassed enclosures when we just throw the food over to them and get them to revert to wild.' 'Sadly if we can't release them, we do have to put them to sleep, which is why we reduce human contact like that.' After they move to their nocturnal sleep rhythm they will be put in glass enclosures and then released .\nSummary: "}
{"article":"It is a remarkable, eye-popping portrait of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Entitled 'Naughty Nicola', the painting depicts her as a dominatrix in a short red dress, black suspenders on display and whip in hand. But instead of being offended, Ms Sturgeon is 'tickled' by the image, so much so it is believed to grace the wall of her suburban Glasgow home after she was given it as a birthday gift by her husband, Peter Murrell. He is the man credited with transforming the nationalist leader from surly apparatchik to national stateswoman \u2013 on the brink of holding the balance of power. Eye-popping: The painting allegedly hanging in the home of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon shows her as a dominatrix (pictured) Couple: The image is said to grace the wall of Sturgeon's (left) suburban Glasgow home after she was given it as a birthday gift by her husband, Peter Murrell (right) Softly spoken, bespectacled and almost unknown outside the Scottish political village, he can walk the busiest streets in Scotland without being recognised. SNP colleagues reveal that within the party, Murrell is affectionately nicknamed Penfold, after Danger Mouse's loyal hamster sidekick in the 1980s cartoon series. Meek, myopic and chubby, Penfold dutifully shouts 'Coming chief', whenever his superior summons him in the cartoons. Some say the similarity extends further. Sturgeon doesn't drive and her husband frequently acts as chauffeur. He also carries out the lion's share of the domestic chores. When Good Morning Britain's Susanna Reid remarked on the immaculate condition of the couple's detached house last month, Sturgeon, 44, said: 'That's because I had my husband up most of last night cleaning.' Scotland's most powerful politician also leaves the cooking to her spouse, stating: 'I don't cook. I have had lots of disasters and now I prefer not to try, but Peter is a good cook and enjoys it.' However, anyone assuming that Murrell's only role is that of dutiful house-husband would be sorely mistaken. As chief executive of the SNP, he has transformed its fortunes, creating a formidable electoral machine.

{"article":"Michael Carrick's outstanding second-half performance for England against Italy on Tuesday night has put him on course to become the longest-serving outfield player to represent the Three Lions behind Sir Stanley Matthews. Carrick made his England debut against Mexico in May 2001 as a teenager with West Ham United and if \u2013 as now seems likely \u2013 he carries through to Euro 2016, he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary Sir Stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years.

Carrick was hailed by Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney as 'the best player on the pitch by a mile' after the 33-year-old was introduced as a half-time substitute in Turin and helped Roy Hodgson's men fight back to earn a 1-1 draw. His longevity already surpasses that of great names like Sir Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore, David Beckham and Gary Lineker and if he continues to play in the next European Championship he will overtake Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard too. The only player to have had a longer career since Matthews is goalkeeper Peter Shilton who played for England between 1971 and 1990. It also begs the question why Carrick, who has won four Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United, has been used so sparingly by his country at international tournaments. He played once at the 2006 World Cup in a 1-0 victory against Ecuador, was in the squad but never played by Fabio Capello in the disastrous 2010 campaign in South Africa, and wasn't even selected by Roy Hodgson last year in Brazil, even though England's perennial problem has been keeping the ball.

{"article":"Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his wife Therese Rein have said goodbye to their family home in Brisbane's east of more than 20 years after slashing over $100,000 off the asking price to pocket $1.14 million. The tropical Queenslander home still managed to sell for over three times what the couple paid when they bought the house just over two decades ago, when they snagged the\u00a0Norman Crescent property for $384,000 in December 1994. The house was snatched up by applied economics Professor Uwe Dulleck, who already owns a home in the area with his wife Monica. Scroll down for video . The two-storey property is a striking Queenslander, aptly painted a sunny yellow with forest green features and weatherboard panelling . Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and wife Therese Rein leave their home in Brisbane in 2013, whilst their son Nicholas (far right) was photographed outside the property in 2012 .

{"article":"David Cameron (pictured) said he knows that when it comes to\u00a0immigration, 'fears and worries' remain . Let me reassure you, I know that when it comes to immigration, fears and worries remain. They were set out on the front page of this newspaper yesterday. And I want to set out exactly the choice before you on May 7. I am not one of those politicians who says they \u2018get\u2019 how people feel about immigration then speaks differently in private. Sitting in the House of Commons from 2001, I had a ringside seat on Labour\u2019s complete failure on immigration \u2013 and it was infuriating. Fake colleges, bogus visas, wide open loopholes, the wrong welfare incentives, sham marriages, an abject failure to deport foreign criminals, migrants bringing family members to Britain even if they couldn\u2019t speak a word of English \u2013 a litany of failure. Underpinning it all was contempt for the views of most British people. We all remember Peter Mandelson\u2019s boast that Labour was practically \u2018sending out search parties\u2019 for migrants. The mess took 13 years to create \u2013 and over the past five years we have been working to turn this around. Economic migration from outside the EU has been capped at 20,700 skilled professionals a year. We have closed down over 850 of those bogus colleges that were basically visa factories. There are new charges for migrants using the NHS; there is no social housing unless you\u2019ve been in an area for two years; and there is no housing benefit full-stop for EU jobseekers. Critically, we now have proper exit checks at our borders so we know who is coming in and going out. On top of all this direct action to control immigration, we recognised that the rising immigration numbers weren\u2019t just about lax borders and a system easily abused; it was about British people not being trained to get into the jobs that were becoming available \u2013 or not incentivised to work at all, because of Labour\u2019s welfare system. So we have had a huge, unprecedented push on welfare and training, with two million young people starting apprenticeships, and vast numbers getting off welfare and into work. The result of all this? Consider these remarkable two facts. Under Labour, for years, 90 per cent of job growth was taken up by foreign workers. With the Conservatives, two-thirds of our job growth now benefits British citizens. That is a remarkable turnaround. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t a lot more to do. It\u2019s clear that, as our economy has taken off, the bigger issue has become migration from within Europe. And while we have not yet reduced net migration down to the tens of thousands each year, it remains the right ambition. So why have many more EU migrants come here? Partly it\u2019s our extraordinary economic success, with Britain creating more jobs than 27 other European countries combined. But large numbers have also been drawn here because of incentives in things like tax credits and welfare. These have been a powerful draw to EU workers. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said under the Conservatives, two-thirds of the UK's job growth now benefits British citizens . That is why, in the manifesto we published last week, we had some very clear and hard-headed proposals. Elect a Conservative government, and I will start negotiating a new deal with Europe straight away. It will involve: no benefits at all for EU jobseekers. If you haven\u2019t got a job within six months, you\u2019ll be required to leave. If you\u2019ve got a job, you will get no in-work benefits until you\u2019ve been here and contributing to our country for at least four years. And no child benefit for children of EU migrants living abroad \u2013 ever. This is what I\u2019m seeking. I will fight, negotiate, do all I can to secure a better deal for Britain. And then we would put this to the British people in an in-out referendum in 2017. The capsizing of a boat full of migrants in the Mediterranean at the weekend was absolutely shocking. Eight hundred people died in the most horrific of circumstances, so it\u2019s also right that Britain \u2013 not just a compassionate country but a strong one too \u2013 does what it can to prevent such scenes from ever happening again. That\u2019s why I went to Brussels yesterday to help deliver a response. Of course, we need more search and rescue missions \u2013 and our Royal Navy is ready to play its part alongside other navies. We need to hunt down the traffickers who prey on human misery, deal with the boats that bring people across the seas and help foster stable conditions in countries which export so much illegal immigration. Only then will we properly get to grips with this situation \u2013 building confidence at home that people can\u2019t come here illegally; and helping people abroad life safe and secure lives. All of this is a serious, grown-up plan for reducing immigration long-term. And it is based on some straightforward values. Immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country; who want to come to Britain, pay their way, make a life here, and abide by British values. This is our approach. And this presents you with a clear choice on immigration on May 7. There can only be one Prime Minister in Number Ten, only one person ultimately responsible for controlling immigration: me, or Ed Miliband. Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased five-fold. His arrogant refusal even to discuss numbers \u2013 let alone speak about any reduction \u2013 tells you all you need to know. But the facts of this election have changed \u2013 and it\u2019s even worse. The only way Ed Miliband can get into Downing Street is if he is propped up by the SNP \u2013 and they have made clear that they want higher levels of immigration. It\u2019s clear: Ed Miliband in Downing Street would increase immigration, not reduce it. And if you\u2019re someone considering voting Ukip because you want a referendum on Europe and controlled immigration, remember that a vote for Ukip makes it harder for Conservatives to win \u2013 and much more likely for Ed Miliband and the SNP to get into government. Then you will get no referendum, and a return to uncontrolled immigration. So this is the choice. If I am Prime Minister after May 7 I will see through this serious, sustained attempt to control immigration long-term. I will get Britain a better deal in Europe \u2013 and I will give the British people the final say in an in-out referendum. If you want those things, there\u2019s only one way to get them: vote Conservative on May 7.","highlights":"Cameron said he knows that 'fear and worries' remain over immigration .\nUnder Tories, two-thirds of UK job growth now benefits British citizens .\nPM said he will continue 'serious, sustained attempt' to control immigration .","id":"5d42bdc710c44c1127f4a82fc80163d1521d3f7a","prediction":["This article discusses the views of David Cameron on the topic of immigration.

If you\u2019ve got a job, you will get no in-work benefits until you\u2019ve been here and contributing to our country for at least four years. And no child benefit for children of EU migrants living abroad \u2013 ever. This is what I\u2019m seeking. I will fight, negotiate, do all I can to secure a better deal for Britain. And then we would put this to the British people in an in-out referendum in 2017. The capsizing of a boat full of migrants in the Mediterranean at the weekend was absolutely shocking. Eight hundred people died in the most horrific of circumstances, so it\u2019s also right that Britain \u2013 not just a compassionate country but a strong one too \u2013 does what it can to prevent such scenes from ever happening again. That\u2019s why I went to Brussels yesterday to help deliver a response. Of course, we need more search and rescue missions \u2013 and our Royal Navy is ready to play its part alongside other navies. We need to hunt down the traffickers who prey on human misery, deal with the boats that bring people across the seas and help foster stable conditions in countries which export so much illegal immigration. Only then will we properly get to grips with this situation \u2013 building confidence at home that people can\u2019t come here illegally; and helping people abroad life safe and secure lives. All of this is a serious, grown-up plan for reducing immigration long-term. And it is based on some straightforward values. Immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country; who want to come to Britain, pay their way, make a life here, and abide by British values. This is our approach. And this presents you with a clear choice on immigration on May 7. There can only be one Prime Minister in Number Ten, only one person ultimately responsible for controlling immigration: me, or Ed Miliband. Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased five-fold. His arrogant refusal even to discuss numbers \u2013 let alone speak about any reduction \u2013 tells you all you need to know. But the facts of this election have changed \u2013 and it\u2019s even worse. The only way Ed Miliband can get into Downing Street is if he is propped up by the SNP \u2013 and they have made clear that they want higher levels of immigration. It\u2019s clear: Ed Miliband in Downing Street would increase immigration, not reduce it. And if you\u2019re someone considering voting Ukip because you want a referendum on Europe and controlled immigration, remember that a vote for Ukip makes it harder for Conservatives to win \u2013 and much more likely for Ed Miliband and the SNP to get into government. Then you will get no referendum, and a return to uncontrolled immigration. So this is the choice. If I am Prime Minister after May 7 I will see through this serious, sustained attempt to control immigration long-term. I will get Britain a better deal in Europe \u2013 and I will give the British people the final say in an in-out referendum. If you want those things, there\u2019s only one way to get them: vote Conservative on May 7.\nSummary: "}
