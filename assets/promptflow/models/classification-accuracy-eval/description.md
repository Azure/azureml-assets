The "Classification Accuracy Evaluation" is a model designed to assess the effectiveness of a data classification system. It involves matching each prediction against the ground truth, subsequently assigning a "Correct" or "Incorrect" score. The cumulative results are then leveraged to generate performance metrics, such as accuracy, providing an overall measure of the system's proficiency in data classification.
