The "QnA Ada Similarity Evaluation" is a model to evaluate the Q&A Retrieval Augmented Generation systems by leveraging the state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLM) to measure the quality and safety of your responses. Utilizing GPT-3.5 as the Language Model to assist with measurements aims to achieve a high agreement with human evaluations compared to traditional mathematical measurements.
