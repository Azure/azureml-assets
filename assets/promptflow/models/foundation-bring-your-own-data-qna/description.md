This sample demonstrates Q&A application powered by a Foundation Model deployment. It utilizes indexed files from Azure Machine Learning to provide grounded answers. You can ask a wide range of questions related to Azure Machine Learning and receive responses. The process involves embedding the raw query, using vector search to find most relevant context in user data, and then using a Open Model deployment to complete questions, based on the documents. This sample also contains multiple prompt variants that you can tune.
