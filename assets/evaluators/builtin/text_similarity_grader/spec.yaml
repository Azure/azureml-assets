description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Float [0â€“1]: 0 is False and 1 is True |\n| What is this metric? | TEXT_SIMILARITY_GRADER evaluates how closely two pieces of text resemble each other in meaning and structure. |\n| How does it work? | It uses metrics like cosine similarity, BERTScore, or ROUGE to assess semantic and lexical overlap. |\n| When to use it? | Use this metric in paraphrase detection, translation evaluation, and response comparison. |\n"
