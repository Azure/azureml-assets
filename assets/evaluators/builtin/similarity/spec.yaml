description: "Measures how closely two pieces of text resemble each other in meaning. Higher scores indicate greater semantic similarity. It’s best used for NLP tasks with a user query. Use it when you want an objective evaluation of an AI model's performance, particularly in text generation tasks where you have access to ground truth responses."
