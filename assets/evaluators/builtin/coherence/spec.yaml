description: "| \t| |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range |\tInteger [1-5]: 1 is the lowest quality and 5 is the highest quality. |\n| What is this metric? | Measures how well the language model can produce output that flows smoothly, reads naturally, and resembles human-like language. |\n| How does it work? | The coherence metric is calculated by instructing a language model to follow the definition (in the description) and a set of grading rubrics, evaluate the user inputs, and output a score on a 5-point scale (higher means better quality). Learn more about our [definition and grading rubrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in?tabs=warning#ai-assisted-coherence).  |\n| When to use it? |\tThe recommended scenario is generative business writing such as summarizing meeting notes, creating marketing materials, and drafting email. |\n| What does it need as input? |\tQuery, Response |\n"
