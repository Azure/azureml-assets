description: "Tool Selection evaluates the appropriateness and efficiency of tool choices made by an AI agent, focusing on relevance, completeness, and avoiding unnecessary tools. This metric analyzes whether the agent selected the right tools for the task, avoided redundant tools, and didn't miss essential tools available in the tool definitions. Use this metric in agent-based systems, orchestration platforms, and AI assistants that need to select appropriate tools from available options."
