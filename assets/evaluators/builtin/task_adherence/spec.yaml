description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Float [0â€“1]: higher means better alignment with task requirements. |\n| What is this metric? | Task Adherence evaluates whether the system's output conforms to the specified task constraints, such as format, scope, and required actions. |\n| How does it work? | This metric uses rule-based or model-based validation to check compliance with task instructions. It may include binary checks or graded scoring based on deviation severity. |\n| When to use it? | Useful for workflow automation, form filling, and structured response generation. |\n"
