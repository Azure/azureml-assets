description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Integer [1â€“5]: 1 is the most ungrounded and 5 is the most factually supported. |\n| What is this metric? | Ungrounded Attributes measures the extent to which a system generates claims or attributes that lack support from source data. |\n| How does it work? | It compares generated content against verified sources using fact-checking models or citation validation. Ungrounded claims reduce the score. |\n| When to use it? | Ideal for evaluating summarization, reporting, and generative AI systems where factual grounding is critical. |\n"
