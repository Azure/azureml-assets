description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Integer [1–5]: higher means better tool usage quality. |\n| What is this metric? | Tool Call Quality measures how well a system invokes external tools (e.g., APIs, plugins) based on user intent and context. |\n| How does it work? | It compares the tool call parameters and timing against expected values using exact match or semantic similarity scoring. |\n| When to use it? | Use this metric in agent-based systems, orchestration platforms, and AI assistants that rely on tool integration. |\n"
