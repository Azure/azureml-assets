description: "| | |\n| -- | -- |\n| Score range | Integer [1–5]: 1 is the lowest quality and 5 is the highest quality. |\n| What is this metric? | Response Completeness measures how thoroughly a system answers a user's query. It evaluates whether all relevant aspects of the question are addressed. |\n| How does it work? | This metric compares the generated response against a comprehensive reference answer using coverage-based scoring. |\n| When to use it? | Ideal for evaluating chatbots, virtual assistants, and QA systems where full and informative responses are critical. |\n"
