Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\r\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\r\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\r\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\r\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\r\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\r\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\r\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\r\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\r\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\r\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\r\nDiana: Thank you. What's your current budget?\r\nTom: We were thinking about \u00a3400 000. Would it be possible?\r\nDiana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?\r\nTom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.\r\nDiana: How much are you aiming for?\r\nTom: At least \u00a3300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.\r\nDiana: Could you please send me some pictures? I would also gladly make an appointment with you.\r\nTom: That would be perfect!\r\nDiana: Would Monday at 8 be acceptable?\r\nTom: Hm, I need to consult it with my wife, but so far it's all right.\n\n","max_tokens":1024}

Actually I got a ban for making a joke which offended someone. It involved a penguin, which as you know can be a very offensive topic.\r\nQuentin: I don't know. People today as so sensitive, but are ignorant anyway.\r\nTarquin: So will you have a good crowd for the unboxing? \r\nQuentin: Only seven for definite. I will do some wine and cheese and we can start opening the boxes at 8pm\r\nTarquin: Sounds great. I will turn up. \r\nQuentin: Great.\r\nTarquin: How many books do you think there will be?\r\nQuentin: About 200, like the other time.\r\nTarquin: how many did you sell on the spot? \r\nQuentin: Only 30, the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.\r\nTarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. \r\nQuentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.\r\nTarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?\r\nQuentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.\r\nTarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?\r\nQuentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.\r\nTarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.\r\nQuentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.\r\nTarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right?\r\nQuentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special \"Quentin price\" only on the evening of the unboxing.

Under current circumstances less and less people read longer forms, such as books, reports or reportages.

I'm sorry if it's an inconvenience.\r\nAurore: Hello... hmmm, well the initial plan was to start with the costumes and that will definitely take over an hour. Of course, there will be other dances and games, but that was ment to be the main event... Are you sure you don't want to take part?\r\nAurore: I'm sorry that I haven't sent you the descriptions of your characters, but I can quickly summarise what part each of you would play (even for Natalie)...

I won't send you your character descriptions - I guess while that event is taking place, you'll have to be next door (there are board games & films, so you should be entertained). Then, when the costume activity has ended (which I would like to point out, doesn't depend on me but on the participants of said activity), you can rejoin us.\r\nJulia: Well, we don't exactly understand what the game is...

I'm sorry for all the trouble we've caused you and thank you for explaining everything.\r\nAurore: It's okay (nature of the job, I suppose). But are you sure?

Before he was able to call the police, they were gone without paying and leaving a total mess behind them.\r\nKate: So I can say we were lucky. Where was it?\r\nJamie: Cienfuegos, Cuba.

The second thing is that in the Government departments both the idle and the ideal are treated in the same manner. The idle ones have no fear to be deprived of their jobs while the ideal have no hope for any rapid progress.\r\nVincent: Victor your CV shows that you have been a very bright student throughout your academic career.

If you think you can't make any progress in Pakistan why don't you try your luck in  another country, let's say in America or England.\r\nVictor: I didn't say that I can't make any progress in Pakistan. I am determined to stay in Pakistan and I strive hard to prove my worth. But sir I need a proper platform from where I can start my journey.

When do you intend to have it done?\r\nHelen: Not sure but I did a lot of phoning round of friends in the medical profession (doctors, surgeons, physios, nurses etc \u2013 14 of them). With one exception they all said to leave it as long as possible. I also spoke to about 11 friends who had had the operation. Every one of them said it was the best thing they had ever done, and to book it in as soon as possible! So that was really helpful!\r\nMicky: Don't you have one surgeon with an overview of your bones' condition? I've got one myself since the first symptoms of arthritis.\r\nHelen: My GP said exercise as much as you can, and if it hurts, keep taking the painkillers! So at the moment that is what I am doing. I have decided to give it a year, and see how the land lies then.\r\nMicky: Sounds sensible. I refused that my knee be operated on 2 years ago and I'm still going strong.\r\nHelen: Exactly! They operate much too often. As long as I can practise sport and have my activities filled holidays I won't get under their knives.\r\nMicky: <file_photo> It's me in the gym the other day. Talking about operations...\r\nHelen: My point exactly!\r\nHelen: <file_photo> And me on a cycling tour in Morocco earlier this year.

I think it's better to send your CV in pdf rather than doc.\r\nJames: Ok\r\nJenny: As for the layout, you have some cool experience and I think the way its presented doesn't give you justice. Netflix is an entertainment company so maybe make it more entertaining? ;) You can use different colours, graphs, make it more visual, not only informative.\r\nJames: Cool, never thought about it!\r\nJenny: It seems like you are a down-to-earth guy which is probably good for a project manager, but at Netflix we highly value the creative side of people :)\r\nJames: Thank you so much Jenny!

In reality, both China and the US are capably of being fully independent.\r\nPeter: I agree to a certain extent.\r\nMartha: Elaborate please\r\nPeter: The \"we have to create  a state of permanent threat for people to need us\" approach but as a historian I know everything works in cycles of war.\r\nMartha: There are plenty of wars out there.

More wars = more profit\r\nMartha: I just think the conflict wouldn't make sense from an economic standpoint. And as much of a crackpot Trump is, he realizes that.\r\nPeter: We're talking about the same Trump who refused meeting with Putin at the g20 summit after Russia attacked the Ukraine?\r\nMartha: I honestly believe they discuss their issues behind closed doors. Known each other for years.\r\nPeter: Yes, but had the meet happened, he would've had to condemn Putin on an international arena.

But they have quite a large influence on Us policies\r\nMartha: That doesn't really matter either. It's not the government who will decide but corporate lobbyists. \r\nPeter: Yes but if they feel like they want to retain control they will just need an excuse to start something\r\nMartha: Not without business support.

So disgusting...\r\nJoddie: Can't you abolish this parody of government before term?\r\nMousie: A seamy side of democracy.\r\nMousie: Have you heard the latest? About the mayor of Gdansk?\r\nMousie: <file_other>\r\nJoddie: NO!!! Why murdered?\r\nMousie: The bloke is obviously mentally unstable but what could've triggered it all off was the shitstorm created around the mayor by the gvt. When the official media say that he's bad then he must be also responsible for my failed life. This sort of thing.\r\nJoddie: So there's no direct, personal connection between the two?\r\nMousie: Not at all! The bloke maintains he'd been maltreated in prison under the PO administration and while Adamowicz was PO, then he'd been responsible for it. Beyond any comment!\r\nJoddie: Who said so?\r\nMousie: That's what he shouted still on the crime scene.\r\nJoddie: Was he apprehended on the spot?\r\nMousie: <file_other>\r\nMousie: The murderer is a puppet, it's the background of his act that is threatening to our future. This ruling party is in fact responsible for Adamowicz's death, not a poor and deluded halfwit (sorry, man!). Adamowicz stood for all that this PeeParty hates: humanitarian treatment of refugees and migrants, tolerant rights for LGBT folks, more liberal abortion laws. You know, although I can't agree with some of his views, the PiS hateful propaganda against Adamowicz has always filled me with utter disgust and disrespect for Kaczynski.\r\nJoddie: I can imagine that it's not exactly your agenda. But nothing to my mind justifies political assassination.\r\nMousie: Can't call it like this. It was in my opinion an act of a politically motivated madman, a psychopath.\r\nMousie: And you know what's so tragic in addition to everything else? It all happened during the latest charity concert of Owsiak`s Orkiestra! The PeeParty jumped immediately on this wagon and accused HIM of fomenting discord in our uniform catholic society. I feel like vomiting!\r\nJoddie: Could never understand those who voted for Kacz and his private party!\r\nMousie: But there was no choice! You have no idea what a bunch of self-supportive buggies PO had become!\r\nJoddie: Yes, I really no longer understand what's going on in Poland...\r\nMousie: After what's happened nobody does.\n\n","max_tokens":1024}

It's going to affect us all in a most adverse manner. No doubt about it.\r\nGloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.\r\nTony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.\r\nTony: When the French protest against their government, they do it on the streets with their Gilets Jaunes. We do protest votes against the government. I\u2019m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!\r\nGloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?\r\nTony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.\r\nTony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick. I've always been out of pocket, no matter whether in Austria or France. And now with the pound going down the drain...\r\nGloria: We are hardly meeting any British tourists in Mexico now. One couple in Campeche the other day but they said they're attending a convention or sth.\r\nTony: That's what I mean. We'll be stewing in our own splendidly isolated sauce again.\r\nGloria: Don't worry. You can always visit us in Austria paying your pounds which we will then spend visiting you in England.\r\nTony: That's a good plan. But how about me visiting France or Spain??? Any family or friends there?\r\nGloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?\r\nTony: Definitely. Those morons voted \"for\" out of ignorance, out of sheer lack of knowledge and understanding. Common awareness of economic and political consequences of Brexit has made a quantum jump in this country as late as in the last few months.\r\nTony: And if you ask me, the Irish border issue cannot be solved thru' any diplomatic channels. It either stays open, the way it is now, or we have a new armed conflict with no prospect of being settled.\r\nGloria: Hasn't it started yet?\r\nTony: Yes. I fear the worst.\r\nGloria: Oh Tony...

{"prompt": "Tessy: Good morning Harry! Just thought I'd drop you a line before disappearing to the other side of the world. At the moment I'm on the train to Frankfurt airport, then off to Cuba for 5 weeks. Can't wait to be there!\r\nHarry: A very good morning to you dear Tessy! How nice you are in touch. So travelling again? Gosh, you've got stamina!\r\nTessy: I wonder myself. Truth to tell I'm slightly apprehensive. Never been to Cuba. Have you?\r\nHarry: No, I'm not that adventurous but Maya was. Last summer with her boys. And I think she was very enthusiastic.But I remember no details. Why don't you ask her? She may have a tip or two.\r\nTessy: A bit too late now :)) but I will definitely contact her. Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?\r\nHarry: Oh yes, it is. She was gone for 2 weeks and I heard from her twice: from the Havana airport when she arrived and on leaving.\r\nTessy: I see! My Super Mario boss is expecting me to be online all the time - just in case. LOL\r\nHarry: What a charming person. Have you told him to fuck off?\r\nTessy: More or less. And hey how are you? Tied down to the ground?\r\nHarry: I hate winter for that reason. But still had a fantastic flying season this year. Can't complain really. We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.\r\nTessy: Smashing! Where to?\r\nHarry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.\r\nTessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?\r\nHarry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland. They're gone mad there, with all those Chinks and Russkis. Nobody else can afford it any more.\r\nTessy: Apart from royals in Kitzb\u00fchel :)) \r\nHarry: Molly has found out about a package, with the flight, full board, accommodation. You only have to pay your ski passes.\r\nTessy: And that's where they are making their money! And on apres-skis!\r\nHarry: I can easily give a miss to a fancy apres-ski! Have you had any bookings? They surely have nice all-inclusive places in Cuba.\r\nTessy: Not at all! Otherwise prices are exorbitant. But those affordable ones always have horrible write-ups. Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)\r\nHarry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip. I definitely prefer hotels.\r\nTessy: I AM more adventurous. Anyway it is safe, Cuba is said to be very safe even for woman travelling alone.\r\nHarry: And ravishing blonde on top of it! But be careful.\r\nTessy: STB you are.\r\nHarry: What the hell is STB?\r\nTessy: Swet Talking Bastard. Anyway it was great to chat with you. I think we're approaching Frankfurt. So see you in January!\r\nTessy: And have a fantastic skiing Xmas!\r\nHarry: Happy and safe trails Tessy!\n\n","max_tokens":1024}

I was 100% certain, you're going to sacrifice Chloe.\r\nHaley: I mean it wasn't an easy decision, but it made sense to me. What did you choose? \r\nNick: I sacrificed Chloe, obviously.\r\nHaley: obviously :P\r\nHaley: You know it's almost 50/50 with this choice among the players\r\nNick: I've seen the statistics, yes. So why did you choose Chloe?\r\nHaley: Because it's actually the one person that you truly care about. Who's like your best friend and means something to you. You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.\r\nNick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother. How do you think that would make her feel?\r\nHaley: I know and as I said it was a devastating choice, but I couldn't let her die after all that emotional build-up.\r\nNick: I sorta get it... in theory. But for me the math was simple. Plus there was this part where you had to see the damage the storm had done and save your classmates and all that. It really got to me.\r\nHaley: I know all that but it was just... pursuit of happiness I guess. Like if it was Josie or your mom, what would you do?\r\nNick: yeah, but for me it wasn't a Josie/mom kind of relationship. Chloe and Max just spent several days together after some long years of zero contact. I just didn't really feel that close to Chloe, I guess.\r\nHaley: I totally adored her and actually felt guilty a lot o f times on Max's behalf for abandoning her like that those years ago. I know Chloe is difficult and troublesome, but for me that was kinda lovable.\r\nNick: I didn't connect with her like that at all. I mean it wasn't ok, what Max did, but I feel like Chloe was constantly guilt tripping Max throughout the game. It was kinda annoying.\r\nHaley: i dindn't really see it that way. Chloe's just sorta emotional, says what she feels.\r\nNick: That's a polite way to put it but ok. :P What about the other choices? And most importantly - did you water the plant? :D\r\nHaley: Yes! :D I watered it exactly right.\r\nNick: Haha, me too. I wish I was able to do that in real life :P\n\n","max_tokens":1024}
