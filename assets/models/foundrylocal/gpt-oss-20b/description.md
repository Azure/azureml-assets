This model is an optimized version of gpt-oss-20b for local inference. Optimized models are published here in ONNX format to run on CPU and GPU across devices, including server platforms, Windows, Linux and Mac desktops, and mobile CPUs, with the precision best suited to each of these targets.

# ONNX Models
Here are some of the optimized configurations we have added:
1.	ONNX model for CPU and mobile using RTN quantization.
2.	ONNX model for GPU using RTN quantization.
