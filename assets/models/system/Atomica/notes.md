## Intended Use

This model uses the Pretrained ATOMICA-interface model checkpoint, which serves for construction of ATOMICANets. See below an excerpt extracted from the [Project Website](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/projects/ATOMICA/) about ATOMICANets:

### ATOMICA’s Interfaceome Networks

We use ATOMICA representations to construct interfaceome networks, which aregraphs linking proteins based on similarity in their interaction interfaces with ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. These ATOMICANet modality-specific networks reveal that proteins sharing similar interface features often participate in the same disease pathways, even across different interaction types. This provides a new molecular-level view of disease mechanisms.

By analyzing disease-associated proteins across 82 diseases, ATOMICANets uncover statistically significant pathway modules in lipid, ion, and small molecule networks. The model predicts disease-relevant interactions for autoimmune neurological disorders and cancer, identifying ion channels in multiple sclerosis and lymphoma-associated proteins across all five interface types. This demonstrates ATOMICA’s value in understanding protein function and disease involvement in a modality-specific, interpretable manner.
