DeiT (Data-efficient image Transformers) is an image transformer that do not require very large amounts of data for training. This is achieved through a novel distillation procedure using teacher-student strategy, which results in high throughput and accuracy. DeiT is pre-trained and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k (1 million images, 1,000 classes) at resolution 224x224. The model was first released in this <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit" target="_blank">repository</a>, but the weights were converted to PyTorch from the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models" target="_blank">timm</a> repository by Ross Wightman.

An image is treated as a sequence of patches and it is processed by a standard Transformer encoder as used in NLP. These patches are linearly embedded, and a [CLS] token is added at the beginning of the sequence for classification tasks. The model also requires absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence Transformer encoder. So the pre-training creates an inner representation of images that can be used to extract features that are useful for downstream tasks. For instance, if a dataset of labeled images is available, a linear layer can be placed on top of the pre-trained encoder, to train a standard classifier.

# Training Details

## Training Data

The DeiT model is pre-trained and fine-tuned on ImageNet 2012, consisting of 1 million images and 1,000 classes on a resolution of 224x224.

## Training Procedure

In the preprocessing step, images are resized to the same resolution 224x224. Different augmentations like Rand-Augment, and random erasing are used. For more details on transformations during training/validation refer <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit/blob/main/datasets.py#L78" target="_blank">this-link</a>. At inference time, images are rescaled to the same resolution 256x256, center-cropped at 224x224 and then normalized across the RGB channels with mean (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and standard deviation (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).

The model was trained on a single 8-GPU node for 3 days. Training resolution is 224. For more details on hyperparameters refer to table 9 of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877" target="_blank">original-paper</a>.

For more details on pre-training (ImageNet-1k) followed by supervised fine-tuning (ImageNet-1k) refer to the section 2 to 5 of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877" target="_blank">original-paper</a>.

# Evaluation Results

DeiT base model achieved top-1 accuracy of 81.8% and top-5 accuracy of 95.6% on ImageNet with 86M parameters with image size 224x224. For DeiT image classification benchmark results, refer to the table 5 of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877" target="_blank">original-paper</a>.

It's important to note that during the fine-tuning process, superior performance is attained with a higher resolution, and enhancing the model size leads to improved performance.
