# **Model Details**

Name: morph-labs-morph-prover-v0-7b

Model Summary: Morph Prover v0 7B by Morph Labs

Developed by: Morph Labs
Language(s) (NLP): English
License: Apache 2.0
Key Features:

Morph Prover v0 7B is the first open-source model designed as a conversational assistant for Lean users.
Developed in collaboration with Nous Research and the Safe and Trustworthy AI Research (STAIR) group at Stanford, led by Professor Sanmi Koyejo.
Significant contributions by Brando Miranda (Stanford), Peter Holderrieth (MIT), and Jin Peng Zhou (Cornell).
Utilizes Nomic AI's GPT4All Vulkan support, making it compatible with any consumer GPU.
Derived from Mistral 7B, it is a chat fine-tune that excels in autoformalization and outperforms the original Mistral model on benchmarks like AGIEval and MMLU.
Trained with a proprietary synthetic data pipeline, utilizing code data generated by the Morph Code Index.

Ethical Considerations and Limitations:

Like all Large Language Models, Morph Prover v0 7B carries inherent risks during use.
Testing has been conducted solely in English, and comprehensive testing for all use scenarios may not be achievable.
The model may produce inaccurate, unsatisfactory, or undesirable outputs. Developers are encouraged to test and fine-tune the model for their specific use cases before deployment.
