All versions of Aurora were extensively evaluated by evaluating predictions on data not seen during training.
These evaluations not only compare measures of accuracy, such as the root mean square error and anomaly correlation coefficient,
but also look at the behaviour in extreme situations, like extreme heat and cold, and rare events, like Storm Ciar√°n in 2023.
These evaluations are the main topic of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13063).
