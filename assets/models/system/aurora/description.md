Aurora is a machine learning model that can predict general environmental variables, such as temperature and wind speed.
It is a _foundation model_, which means that it was first generally trained on a lot of data,
and then can be adapted to specialised environmental forecasting tasks with relatively little data.
We provide four such specialised versions:
one for medium-resolution weather prediction,
one for high-resolution weather prediction,
one for air pollution prediction,
and one for ocean wave prediction.
Currently, this implementation only includes the version for medium-term weather prediction.
Please see the documentation of the Aurora Foundry Python API linked below for
precisely which models are available.
