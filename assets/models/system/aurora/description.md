Aurora is a machine learning model that can predict general environmental variables, such as temperature and wind speed.
It is a _foundation model_, which means that it was first generally trained on a lot of data,
and then can be adapted to specialised environmental forecasting tasks with relatively little data.
We provide four such specialised versions:
one for medium-resolution weather prediction,
one for high-resolution weather prediction,
one for air pollution prediction,
and one for ocean wave prediction.
Please see the documentation of the
[Aurora Foundry Python API](https://microsoft.github.io/aurora/foundry/intro.html).

Please email [AIWeatherClimate@microsoft.com](AIWeatherClimate@microsoft.com)
if you are interested in using Aurora for commercial applications.
For research-related questions or technical support with the open-source version of the model,
please [open an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/aurora/issues/new/choose)
or reach out to the authors of the paper.
