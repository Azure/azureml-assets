Aurora: A Foundation Model for the Earth System

Aurora is a machine learning model that can predict atmospheric variables, such as temperature.
It is a _foundation model_, which means that it was first generally trained on a lot of data,
and then can be adapted to specialised atmospheric forecasting tasks with relatively little data.
We provide four such specialised versions:
one for medium-resolution weather prediction,
one for high-resolution weather prediction,
one for air pollution prediction,
and one for ocean wave prediction.

## Resources

* [Aurora Documentation for detailed instruction and examples](https://microsoft.github.io/aurora)
* [Aurora Academic Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13063)
* [A full-fledged example that runs the model on ERA5](https://microsoft.github.io/aurora/example_era5.html).

## Implementation

_The package currently includes the pretrained model and the fine-tuned version for high-resolution weather forecasting._
_We are working on the fine-tuned versions for air pollution and ocean wave forecasting, which will be included in due time._
