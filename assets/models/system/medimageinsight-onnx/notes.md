## Ethical Considerations and Limitations 

Microsoft believes Responsible AI is a shared responsibility, and we have identified six principles and practices that help organizations address risks, innovate, and create value: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. When downloaded or used in accordance with our terms of service, developers should work with their supporting model team to ensure this model meets requirements for the relevant use case and addresses unforeseen product misuse.

While testing the model with images and/or text, ensure the data is PHI free and that there are no patient information or information that can be tracked to a patient identity.

The model is not designed for the following use cases:
* **Use by clinicians to inform clinical decision-making, as a diagnostic tool, or as a medical device** - MedImageInsight is not designed or intended to be deployed as-is in clinical settings nor is it for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or other conditions (including to support clinical decision-making), or as a substitute of professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or clinical judgment of a healthcare professional.


* **Scenarios without consent for data** - Any scenario that uses health data for a purpose for which consent was not obtained.

* **Use outside of health scenarios** - Any scenario that uses non-medical related image and/or serving purposes outside of the healthcare domain.
