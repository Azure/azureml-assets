  licensedescription: "**PAIGE.AI, INC. EMBEDDING SERVICES TERMS OF USE**
**Updated as of November 11, 2025**

These terms of use (the “***Terms of Use***”) are between Paige.AI, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “***Paige***”, “***us***”, “***we***”, or “***our***”) and you and/or the entity or organization you represent.

By accessing or using the Embeddings Service (defined below), you agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not accept these Terms of Use, do not use the Embeddings Service.

You are representing that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor) and have the capacity and authority to enter into these Terms of Use. If you are entering into these Terms of Use for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity. You agree that “***you***”, “***your***” or “***user***” as used in these Terms of Use includes you, personally, and, if applicable, any entity you represent.

We reserve the right to change these Terms of Use from time to time for any reason, which shall be affected by posting the updated Terms of Use here. Your continued use of the Embeddings Services after any changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use.

**Arbitration**

THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. You agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. If you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules (as defined below). Any arbitration under these Terms of Use will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.

# 1. Description. Paige provides an embeddings service where Paige processes whole slide images you submit to Paige (“the “Input Data”) through its Virchow2, Virchow2G, Virchow2G-mini and PRISM computer vision models (the “Models”) to generate representations of the semantic meaning and relationships of the Input Data in a high-dimensional vector space (the “Embeddings”), (the “Embeddings Service”).
