DistilBERT is a smaller and faster version of BERT, a transformers model that was trained on a large amount of text without any human annotations.
DistilBERT used the BERT base model as a teacher to learn from the same text corpus in a self-supervised way. 
The training process involved three objectives:

Distillation loss: the model tried to match the output probabilities of the BERT base model.
Masked language modeling (MLM): this is a common objective for pretraining transformers models. The model randomly masks some words in a sentence and then tries to predict them using the whole sentence as input. This allows the model to capture the context from both directions, unlike RNNs or autoregressive models like GPT.
Cosine embedding loss: the model also tried to produce hidden states that are similar to those of the BERT base model.

DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model based on Bert architecture. It has 40% less parameters than bert-base-uncased, runs 60% faster while preserving 97% of BERT's performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark



This English language question answering model has a F1 score of 87.1 on SQuAD v1.1 and was developed by Hugging Face under the Apache 2.0 license. Training the model requires significant computational power, such as 8 16GB V100 GPUs and 90 hours. Intended uses include fine-tuning on downstream tasks, but it should not be used to create hostile or alienating environments and limitations and biases should be taken into account.
<br>Please Note: This model accepts masks in `[mask]` format. See Sample input for reference.Â
