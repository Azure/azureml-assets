The DistilBERT base model (uncased) is a distilled version of the BERT base model that is smaller and faster than BERT. It was introduced in a specific paper and the code for creating the model can be found on a specific webpage. The model is uncased so it doesn't differentiate between lower and upper case letters in the English language. DistilBERT is considered a transformers model that was pretrained on the same corpus in a self-supervised fashion using the BERT base model as a teacher.  The training process involved three objectives:

1. Distillation loss: The model was trained to produce similar probability distributions as the BERT base model.
2. Masked Language Modeling (MLM): The model masked 15% of the words in a sentence, then predicted those masked words after processing the entire sentence. This bidirectional approach allows the model to learn contextual information.
3. Cosine embedding loss: The model was also trained to generate hidden states that closely match those of the BERT base model.
DistilBERT's design results in it learning similar language representations as the BERT base model but with improved inference speed and efficiency. It's suitable for various tasks, such as masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, but its primary use is fine-tuning on downstream tasks. It's particularly well-suited for tasks like sequence classification, token classification, and question answering, where the entire sentence (possibly masked) is used for decision-making.

### Training procedure
Preprocessing
The texts are lowercased and tokenized using WordPiece and a vocabulary size of 30,000. The inputs of the model are then of the form:

[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]

With probability 0.5, sentence A and sentence B correspond to two consecutive sentences in the original corpus and in the other cases, it's another random sentence in the corpus. Note that what is considered a sentence here is a consecutive span of text usually longer than a single sentence. The only constrain is that the result with the two "sentences" has a combined length of less than 512 tokens.

The details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:

15% of the tokens are masked.
In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by [MASK].
In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.
In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.
Pretraining
The model was trained on 8 16 GB V100 for 90 hours. See the training code for all hyperparameters details.
