Whisper is a model that can recognize and translate speech using deep learning. It was trained on a large amount of data from different sources and languages. Whisper models can handle various tasks and domains without needing to adjust the model.

Whisper large-v3 is similar to the previous large models, but it has some minor changes:

    It uses 128 Mel frequency bins instead of 80 for the input 
    It adds a new language token for Cantonese

The Whisper large-v3 model was trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudolabeled audio generated by Whisper large-v2. The model was trained for 2.0 epochs on this mixed data.

The large-v3 model shows better performance than Whisper large-v2 on many languages, reducing errors by 10% to 20%.
