The dolly-v2-12b model is a large, instruction-following language model created by Databricks, Inc. and is licensed for commercial use. It is based on EleutherAIâ€™s Pythia-12b and was trained on a 15,000-record instruction corpus generated by Databricks employees, which was released under a CC-BY-SA license. It is not a state-of-the-art model, but it does exhibit high-quality instruction-following behavior that is not characteristic of the foundation model on which it is based.
