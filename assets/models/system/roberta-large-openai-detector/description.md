RoBERTa Large OpenAI Detector is a fine-tuned transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI to detect text generated by GPT-2 models. The model has an accuracy of approximately 95% for detecting 1.5B GPT-2-generated text, but the developers note that accuracy may decrease as model sizes increase. The model should not be used to intentionally harm others or support efforts to evade detection, but the model could be used in research related to synthetic text generation. The model has limitations and biases, including disturbing stereotypes and harmful biases, which are discussed further in the associated paper. The model is trained using a sequence classifier based on RoBERTa Large and fine-tuned using the outputs of the 1.5B GPT-2 model. It is evaluated on test data consisting of 5,000 samples from the WebText dataset and 5,000 samples generated by a GPT-2 model.
