## Intended Uses

The MatterSim model is intended for property predictions of materials.

### Direct Use

The model is used for materials simulation and property prediciton tasks. An interface to atomic simulation environment is provided. Examples of direct usages include but not limited to

- Direct prediction of energy, forces and stress of a given materials
- Phonon prediction using finite difference
- Molecular dynamics

### Out-of-Scope Use

The model only supports atomistic simulations of materials and molecules. Any attempt and interpretation beyond that should be avoided.
The model does not support generation of new materials as it is designed for materials simulation and property prediction only.
The model is intended for research and experimental purposes. Further testing/development are needed before considering its application in real-world scenarios.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The current model has relatively low accuracy for organic polymeric systems.
Accuracy is inferior to the best (more computationally expensive) methods available.
The model is trained on a specific variant of Density Functional Theory (PBE) that has known limitations across chemical space which will affect accuracy of prediction, such as the ability to simulate highly-correlated systems. (The model can be fine-tuned with higher accuracy data.)
The model does not support all capabilities of some of the latest models such as predicting Born effective charges or simulating a material in an applied electric field.
We have evaluated the model on many examples, but there are many examples that are beyond our available resources to test.

### Recommendations

For any appications related simulations of surfaces, interfaces, and systems with long-range interactions, the results are often qualitatively correct. For quantitative results, the model needs to be fine-tuned.
