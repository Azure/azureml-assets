<!-- `description.md` is required. -->

Paragraph 1 explains what the model is, and what tasks it is good for. Focus on describing the value proposition of your model so that the user can immediate grasp the feature offering of your model. Avoid description that can be easily outdated in the future (ex. the latest in X model family).

Paragraph 2 describes the model's capabilities, context window, and other training related information.

*Example:*

*Phi-3.5-MoE is a lightweight, state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) open small language model built upon datasets used for Phi-3 - synthetic data and filtered publicly available documents - with a focus on very high-quality, reasoning dense data. They are designed to be highly capable and cost-effective in language, reasoning, coding, and math tasks.*

*Phi-3.5-MoE supports multilingual and comes with 128K context length (in tokens). The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.*
