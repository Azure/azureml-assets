RoBERTa Base OpenAI Detector is a language model developed by OpenAI that is fine-tuned using outputs from the 1.5B GPT-2 model. It is designed to detect text generated by GPT-2 and is not meant to be used for malicious purposes or to evade detection. The main focus of the model is to aid in synthetic text generation research, but users should be aware of its limitations, risks and potential biases, including accuracy and robustness limitations and the possibility of bias and stereotypes. The associated paper provides information on the training procedure and results from testing, which showed that the model achieved approximately 95% accuracy in detecting text generated by GPT-2, with a higher accuracy when trained using nucleus sampling. Further improvement to the model's effectiveness is said to require methods such as metadata-based approaches, human judgment, and public education.
