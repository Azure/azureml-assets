# Model Deployment Component
This component can be used in [azure machine learning pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines?view=azureml-api-2) to [deploy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=azure-cli) the model in [workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-workspace?view=azureml-api-2).

    36. Standard_ND96amsr_A100_v4

3. _instance_count_ (integer, optional)

    Number of instances you want to use for deployment. Make sure instance type have enough quota available.
    Default value is "1".

4. _egress_public_network_access_ (string, optional)

    This flag secures the deployment by restricting communication between the deployment and the Azure resources used by it. Set to disabled to ensure that the download of the model, code, and images needed by your deployment are secured with a private endpoint. This flag is applicable only for managed online endpoints. Default value is "enabled"
    Possible values
    1. enabled
    2. disabled

## 3.3 Request Settings Parameters

1. _max_concurrent_requests_per_instance_ (integer, optional)

    Maximum concurrent requests to be handled per instance. Default value is "1".

# 4. Run Settings

This setting helps to choose the compute for running the component code.

> Select *Use other compute target*

- Under this option, you can select either `compute_cluster` or `compute_instance` as the compute type and the corresponding instance / cluster created in your workspace.
- If you have not created the compute, you can create the compute by clicking the `Create Azure ML compute cluster` link that's available while selecting the compute. See the figure below
![other compute target](https://aka.ms/azureml-ft-docs-create-compute-target)
- We generally recommend to use Standard_DS3_v2 compute for this node.
